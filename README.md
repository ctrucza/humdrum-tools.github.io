Compiling website
=================

To compile the website, type the following command:
```bash
	make doc
```
This will process the files in the "source" directory and update the
HTML files in the "html" directory.  If there is an error compiling 
the HTML files, you probably need to install Sphinx first, so follow
the instructions in the section below.


Installing Sphinx
-----------------

In order to compile the source files, you need to have
[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org).  How to do this will depend
on your OS and local configuration.  The basic installation process
should be something like this:

* Install sphinx with pip:
```bash
	sudo pip install sphinx
```

* If you have problems installing, try installing pip:
```bash
	sudo easy_install pip
```

* Check to see if sphinx was installed successfully:
```bash
	which sphinx-build
```
  which should reply something like this:
```bash
	/usr/local/bin/sphinx-build
```

After Sphinx has been installed, you will also have to install 
the RtD theme for Sphinx which the documentation uses as a style
theme.  The RtD theme is available on GitHub from
https://github.com/snide/sphinx_rtd_theme .

```bash
	sudo pip install sphinx_rtd_theme
```

[Pygments](http://pygments.org) is needed in order to add syntax highlighting:

```bash
	sudo pip install pygments
```

[Pandoc](http:) is useful for converting content files into 
RST format used in Sphinx:

```bash
	brew install pandoc     # with Homebrew in OS X
	yum install pandoc	# in linux
	apt-get install pandoc  # alternate method in linux
```

Example conversions, where ```-f``` means *from* and ```-t``` means *to*:

```bash
	# Covert HTML files into rst files:
	pandoc -f html -t rst file.html > file.rst

	# Covert Wikipedia wiki files into rst files:
	pandoc -f mediawiki -t rst file.wiki > file.rst
```
