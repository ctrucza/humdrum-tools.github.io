<h1>Representing Music Using <strong>***kern*</strong> (I)<a class="headerlink" href="#representing-music-using-kern-i" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">**kern</span></tt> representation can be used to represent basic or core
information for common Western music. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">**kern</span></tt> scheme can be used to
encode pitch and duration, plus other common score-related information. In
this chapter, we will introduce <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">**kern</span></tt> through a series of tutorial
examples. A more comprehensive description of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">**kern</span></tt> will be given in
<a class="reference external" href="guide06.html">Chapter 6.</a> Our intention here is to provide a quick introduction.</p>
<p>Consider the opening motive from J.S. Bach&#8217;s <em>Art of Fugue</em> shown in Example
2.1. A corresponding <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">**kern</span></tt> representation is given below the notation.</p>

<p>In general, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">**kern</span></tt> is intended to represent the underlying <em>functional</em>
information conveyed by a musical score rather than the visual or
<em>orthographic</em> information found in a given printed rendition. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">**kern</span></tt>
representation is designed to facilitate analytic applications rather than
music printing or sound generation. Nevertheless, both visual output and
sound output can be generated from the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">**kern</span></tt> representation.</p>
<p>Notice that whereas the notation is laid out horizontally across the page,
the Humdrum representation procedes vertically down the page. The
representation begins with the keyword <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">**kern</span></tt> which indicates that the
ensuing encoded material conforms to the kern representation. The encoded
passage ends with a special <a href="#id36"><span class="problematic" id="id37">`*terminator*`_</span></a> token (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*-</span></tt>).</p>
<p>The clef is identified as a G-clef positioned on the second line of the staff
(i.e., a treble clef). The key signature is encoded as a single flat, B-flat:
the minus sign here indicates a flat. The meter signature (2/2) is encoded
next.</p>
<p>Lines that begin with an equals-sign indicate <em>logical</em> barlines. Musical
works may begin with either a complete measure or a partial measure. In the
`` <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">**</span></a>kern`` representation, the beginning of the first measure is explicitly
indicated. In Example 2.1, the encoding for the first barline (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">=-</span></tt>) is a
functional encoding that doesn&#8217;t correspond to anything in the printed score.
The minus sign following the equals-sign indicates that the barline is
&#8220;invisible.&#8221; The presence of this logical barline allows various Humdrum
tools to recognize that the initial notes start at the beginning of the first
measure, and are not &#8220;pick-up&#8221; notes prior to the first measure.</p>
<p>The durations of the notes are indicated by reciprocal numbers: 1 for whole-
note, 2 for half-note, 4 for quarter-note, etc. The <em>breve</em> or double whole-
note is a special case and is represented by the number zero.</p>
<p>Stem directions are encoded using the slash (/) for up-stems and the back-
slash () for down-stems.</p>
<p>Pitches are represented through a scheme of upper- and lower-case letters.
Middle C (C4) is represented using the single lower-case letter &#8220;<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">c</span></tt>&#8221;.
Successive octaves are designated by letter repetition, thus C5 is
represented by &#8220;<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cc</span></tt>&#8221;, C6 by &#8220;<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ccc</span></tt>&#8221; and so on. The higher the octave,
the more repeated letters.</p>
<p>For pitches below C4, upper-case letters are used: &#8220;<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C</span></tt>&#8221; designates C3,
&#8220;<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CC</span></tt>&#8221; designates C2, and so on. Changes of octave occur between B and C.
Thus the B below middle C is represented as &#8220;<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">B</span></tt>&#8221;; the B below &#8220;<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CC</span></tt>&#8221; is
represented as &#8220;<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">BBB</span></tt>&#8221;, and so on. The lower the octave, the greater the
number of repeated letters.</p>
<p>Accidentals are encoded using the octothorpe (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#</span></tt>) for sharps, the minus
sign (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-</span></tt>) for flats, and the lower-case letter &#8220;<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">n</span></tt>&#8221; for naturals.
Accidentals are encoded immediately following the pitch letter name. Double-
sharps and double-flats have no special representations in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">**kern</span></tt> and are
simply denoted by repetition: (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">##</span></tt>) and (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--</span></tt>) respectively. Triple and
quadruple accidentals are similarly encoded by repetition. Sharps, flats, and
naturals are mutually exclusive in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">**kern</span></tt>, so tokens such as &#8220;<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cc#n</span></tt>&#8221;
and &#8220;<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GG-#</span></tt>&#8221; are illegal.</p>
<p>In Example 2.2, two musical parts are encoded. In the corresponding
`` <a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">**</span></a>kern`` encoding, each musical part or voice has been assigned to a
different musical staff &#8211; labelled <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*staff1</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*staff2</span></tt>. Notice that
the upper part has been encoded in the right-most column. The layout is
exactly as though the musical score were turned sideways.</p>

&gt;``*-<a href="#id5"><span class="problematic" id="id6">*</span></a>-``</p>
<p>Each column contains its own separate information. Both columns have been
labelled <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">**kern</span></tt> and are terminated (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*-</span></tt>). The columns are separated by
a single tab. Barline information is also encoded in each column. Notice that
measure numbers have been added following the barline indicator (=). Although
measure numbers may not be present in the printed score, it is normal to
include them in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">**kern</span></tt> encodings.</p>
<p>A notable feature when representing multi-part music is the presence of place
holders called <a href="#id38"><span class="problematic" id="id39">`*null tokens*.`_</span></a> A null token is represented by a single
isolated period character (.). Not all musical parts will have a new note
with each successive sonority. A null token maintains the grid structure for
a sustained pitch while another part is moving.</p>
<p>Rests are encoded by the lower-case letter <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`r</span></tt>&#8216;. Notice that the first
rest in the lower part has not been encoded as a whole rest. Instead, it has
been rendered as a dotted half rest. This is a good illustration of how
`` <a href="#id7"><span class="problematic" id="id8">**</span></a>kern`` is intended to be a <em>functional</em> rather than <em>orthographic</em>
(visual) representation. Nevertheless, users can explicitly indicate that the
rest is visually rendered as a whole rest by adding a second lower-case
letter <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">r</span></tt>.</p>
<p>Another important difference between functional and orthographic
representations is evident in the treatment of accidentals. In the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">**kern</span></tt>
representation, all pitches are encoded without regard for what is going on
around them. For example, in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">**kern</span></tt>, pitches are encoded with the
appropriate accidental, even if the accidental is specified in a key-
signature or is present earlier in the same measure. Hence the explicit
encoding of all occurrences of B-flats in Example 2.2.</p>
<p>All pitches are encoded as absolute pitches. In <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">**kern</span></tt>, even transposing
instruments are always represented at (sounding) concert pitch. A special
<em>transposition interpretation</em> is provided to indicate the nature of any
transposing instrument &#8211; but the encoded pitches &#8211; selves appear only at
concert pitch.</p>
<p>Finally, pitches in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">**kern</span></tt> are encoded as &#8220;nominally&#8221; equally-tempered
values. A special <em>temperament interpretation</em> is provided to indicate if the
tuning system is other than equal temperament.</p>
<p>Two other aspects of Example 2.2 are noteworthy. In measure 3 an inverted
mordent appears on the first note in the bass part. Mordents are encoded via
the letter <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`M</span></tt>&#8216; &#8211; upper-case <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`M</span></tt>&#8216; for whole-tone mordents and lower-
case <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`m</span></tt>&#8216; for semitone mordents. Inverted mordents are similarly encoded
using the letter <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`W</span></tt>&#8216;. In Example 2.2, it is not clear whether the mordent
should be a semitone (consistent with a G harmonic minor figure) or a whole-
tone mordent (consistent with a G melodic minor figure). The signifier
`` <cite>Ww`</cite>&#8216; is a special representation indicating that the ornament may be
either one.</p>
<p>Also evident in Example 2.2 are the upper-case letters <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`L</span></tt>&#8216; and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`J</span></tt>&#8216;.
These encode beaming information. Each beam is opened by the letter <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`L</span></tt>&#8216;
and closed by the letter <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`J</span></tt>&#8216; (think of left and right angles). Multiple
beams and partial beams are discussed in Example 2.4.</p>
<p>Example 2.3 shows a four-part chorale harmonization by Bach. In this example,
two musical parts share each of the two staves. Notice how the corresponding
`` <a href="#id9"><span class="problematic" id="id10">**</span></a>kern`` encoding assigns each part to a separate column, but links the
appropriate parts using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*staff</span></tt> indicators.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2.3.</strong> <em>Nun danket alle Gott</em>, arr. J.S. Bach.</p>

&gt;``*-<em>-</em>-<a href="#id11"><span class="problematic" id="id12">*</span></a>-``</p>
<p>Once again, clefs, key signatures and meter signatures are encoded separately
for each part. Notice how the meter signature has been encoded as 4/4 rather
than <cite>common time&#8217;. This again reflects ``**kern`</cite>&#8216;s preoccupation with
functional information rather than orthographic information. (Later we will
see how to encode the fact that the meter signature is visually rendered as
<a href="#id13"><span class="problematic" id="id14">`</span></a>C&#8217; rather than 4/4.)</p>
<p>In measure 2, pauses (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">;</span></tt>) have been encoded for all four voices even
though only two pause symbols appear in the printed notation.</p>
<p>In the third measure, the last note of the alto part has been tied into the
fourth measure. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">**kern</span></tt> representation provides no generic means for
representing &#8220;curved lines&#8221; found in printed scores. Since <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">**kern</span></tt> is a
&#8220;functional&#8221; rather than an &#8220;orthographic&#8221; representation, all lines are
explicitly interpreted as either <em>ties, slurs</em> or <em>phrases.</em></p>
<p>The open brace <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">{</span></tt> denotes the beginning of a phrase. The closed brace
`` }`` denotes the end of a phrase.</p>
<p>The open parenthesis <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">(</span></tt> and closed parenthesis <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">)</span></tt> signify the beginning
and end of a slur respectively.</p>
<p>The open square bracket <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[</span></tt> denotes the first note of a tie. The closed
square bracket <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">]</span></tt> denotes the last note of a tie. The underscore character
`` <a href="#id15"><span class="problematic" id="id16">_`</span></a>` denotes middle notes (if any) of a tie.</p>
<p>Slurs and phrase markings can be <em>nested</em> (e.g. slurs within slurs) and may
also be <em>elided</em> (e.g. overlapping phrases) to a single depth. <em>Nested
markings</em> mean that one slur or phrase is entirely subsumed under another
slur or phrase. For example: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">(</span> <span class="pre">(</span> <span class="pre">)</span> <span class="pre">)</span></tt> means that a short slur has occurred
within a longer slur. <em>Elisions</em> are overlaps, for example, where an existing
phrase fails to end while a new phrase begins. In <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">**kern</span></tt> the ampersand
character (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&amp;</span></tt>) is used to mark elided slurs or phrases. For example: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">{</span>
<span class="pre">&amp;{</span> <span class="pre">}</span> <span class="pre">&amp;}</span></tt> means that two phrases overlap &#8211; the first phrase ending after the
second phrase has begun.</p>
<p>Example 2.3 ends with a repeat sign. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">**kern</span></tt> representation makes a
distinction between repeat signs that appear in the score and repeat signs
that are obeyed in performance. In this example, only the visual or
orthographic rendering of the barline has been encoded. Later, in <a class="reference external" href="guide20.html">Chapter
20,</a> we will see how sectional repeats are functionally represented. The
visual appearance of the final barline is encoded as follows: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">=:|!</span></tt>. The
equals-sign indicates the logical presence of a barline. The colon indicates
the repeat sign, followed by a thin line (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">|</span></tt>), followed by a thick line
(<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">!</span></tt>).</p>
<p>Example 2.4 shows a keyboard work by Franz Joseph Haydn. In this example, the
lower staff appears to have two concurrent voices. The excerpt has been
encoded using three spines, two of which encode material appearing on the
same staff. Notice that key signatures are provided that explicitly indicate
that there are no sharps or flats in the key signature.</p>
<p>The upper-most part in the first measure shows the use of partial beams.
Partial beams that extend to the left are encoded by the lower-case letter
`` <cite>k`</cite>&#8216;. Partial beams that extend to the right are encoded by the upper-case
`` <cite>K`</cite>&#8216;. Letters are repeated for each partial beam present. In this case,
only a single partial beam is used, so only a single <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`k</span></tt>&#8216; is encoded.
Notice that the signifiers <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`L</span></tt>&#8216; and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`J</span></tt>&#8216; are used only to encode
complete beams.</p>
<p>In the second-last measure, double beams are used to join the sixteenth-note
pairs. As a result, the beams are started with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`LL</span></tt>&#8216; and end with
`` <cite>JJ`</cite>&#8216;.</p>

<p>Slurs are evident in the third measure. Open and closed slurs are represented
by open (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">(</span></tt>) and closed (``)``) parentheses respectively. Notice that the
middle part in the third measure contains a tied note. Considering the
presence of concurrent slurs in the other parts it is possible that an
appropriate interpretation of the score would regard the middle voice as also
slurred. Notice that in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">**kern</span></tt> representation, notes can be tied,

<p>In any representation, some information may best be conveyed as an appended
commentary, rather than as part of the encoded data. Humdrum comments are
records (lines) that begin with an exclamation mark.</p>
<p>Humdrum distinguishes two basic types of comments. Comments that pertain to
all spines in a file are referred to as <em>global comments</em> and begin with two
exclamation marks (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">!!</span></tt>). Comments that pertain to a single spine are
called <em>local comments</em> and begin with a single exclamation mark in each
spine. Both types of comments are evident in Example 2.5.</p>
<p>The first three records are global comments identifying the source and title
of the piece. The fifth record encodes a local comment in each column. One
local comment identifies that the lyrics are in the Ojibway language. On the
same line, notice that the other spine also encodes single exclamation mark,
but contain no text. Such isolated exclamation marks are referred to as <em>null
local comments.</em></p>
<p>Notice that <em>local comments</em> conform to the prevailing spine structure. Each
spine begins with an exclamation mark and tabs continue to demarcate each
spine. <em>Global comments</em> by contrast completely ignore the spines.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2.5.</strong> Ojibway Song.</p>

<h2>Reference Records<a class="headerlink" href="#reference-records" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A particularly important type of global comment is the <a href="#id40"><span class="problematic" id="id41">`*reference record.*`_</span></a>
Reference records are formal ways of encoding &#8220;library-type&#8221; information
pertaining to a Humdrum document. Reference records provide standardized ways
of encoding bibliographic information &#8211; suitable for computer-based access.</p>
<p>Humdrum reference records are designated by three exclamation marks at the
beginning of a line, followed by a letter code, followed by an optional
number, followed by a colon, followed by some text. The following example
provides a set of reference records related to the &#8220;Augurs of Spring&#8221; section
from Stravinsky&#8217;s <em>Rite of Spring.</em> Example 2.6.</p>
<p>`` !!!COM: Stravinsky, Igor Fyodorovich
`` !!!CDT: 1882/6/17/-1971/4/6
`` !!!ODT: 1911//-1913//; 1947//
`` !!!OPT&#64;&#64;RUS: Vesna svyashchennaya
`` <a class="reference external" href="mailto:!!!OPT&#37;&#52;&#48;FRE">!!!OPT<span>&#64;</span>FRE</a>: Le sacre du printemps
`` <a class="reference external" href="mailto:!!!OPT&#37;&#52;&#48;ENG">!!!OPT<span>&#64;</span>ENG</a>: Rite of Spring
`` <a class="reference external" href="mailto:!!!OTL&#37;&#52;&#48;FRE">!!!OTL<span>&#64;</span>FRE</a>: Les augures printaniers
`` !!!PUB: Boosey &amp; Hawkes
`` !!!YEC: 1945 Boosey &amp; Hawkes
`` !!!AGN: ballet
`` !!!AST: neo-classical
`` !!!AMT: irregular
`` !!!AIN: clars corno fagot flt oboe``</p>
<p>Reference records need not be in any particular order. The most important
reference records (composer, title, etc.) are typically placed at the very
beginning of a file since this makes inspecting the file easier. Less
important reference records are typically placed at the end of the file.</p>
<p>Reference codes that begin with the letter <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`C</span></tt>&#8216; pertain to the composer.
The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`COM</span></tt>&#8216; code identifies the composer (surname first followed by given
names). The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`CDT</span></tt>&#8216; code identifies the composer&#8217;s birth and death dates. A
special format is used in defining such dates, and so there are accurate ways
to represent uncertainty, approximation, ranges of dates, and alternative
dates. The <em>Humdrum Reference Manual</em> describes date formats in great detail.</p>
<p>Reference codes that begin with the letter <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`O</span></tt>&#8216; pertain to the work or
opus. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`OTL</span></tt>&#8216; code identifies the title of the encoded material &#8211; in
this case the <cite>*Les augures printaniers*&#8217;. The ```OPT`</cite>&#8216; code identifies the
<cite>parent&#8217; work from which the encoded music belongs. The ```ODE`</cite>&#8216; code
identifies the name of a person or organization to which the work was
dedicated. All three of these records (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">OTL</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">OPT</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ODE</span></tt>) are
encoded using the original language.</p>
<p>Language designations are explicitly indicated by following a reference code
with one or two &#8220;at&#8221; signs (&#64;) followed by a three letter language code. The
`` <cite>OPT&#64;ENG`</cite>&#8216; code is used to provide an English translation. In this case,
the Russian title (<em>Vesna svyashchennaya</em>) is translated as <em>Rite of Spring</em>.
The double &#8220;at&#8221; sign (&#64;&#64;) is used to designate the original, primary, or
preferred language.</p>
<p>Reference codes beginning with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`P</span></tt>&#8216; pertain to publishing and imprint
information. (Codes beginning with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`S</span></tt>&#8216; can be used to identify manuscript
sources, library or archive locations, and other source-related data.)</p>
<p>Codes beginning with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`Y</span></tt>&#8216; identify copyright information. Humdrum defines
separate codes for publisher of the electronic edition, publisher of the
original source document, date of copyright, date of data release, country of
copyright, copyright message, original copyright owner, original year of
publication, and other information. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`YEC</span></tt>&#8216; reference record shown in
Example 2.6 simply encodes the date and copyright owner of the electronic
document.</p>
<p>Codes that begin with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`A</span></tt>&#8216; identify analytic information concerning the
document. The code <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`AMT</span></tt>&#8216; provides a metric classification. Meters may be
classified using combinations of the following keywords: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">simple,</span> <span class="pre">compound,</span>
<span class="pre">duple,</span> <span class="pre">triple,</span> <span class="pre">quadruple,</span> <span class="pre">irregular</span></tt>. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`AGN</span></tt>&#8216; code is used to provide
a free-form text that helps to identify the genre of the work. In this case
the genre is identified as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ballet</span></tt>. Other suitable characterizations may
include opera, string quartet, concerto, barbershop quartet, folksong, and so
on. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`AST</span></tt>&#8216; code can be used to identify the style or period of work.
Once again, this is a free-form text record. Suitable keywords might include
terms such as baroque, bebop, bossa nova, Ecole Notre Dame, minimalist, high-
life, hip-hop, reggae, etc. Such analytic information is obviously
interpretive and often open to disagreement. Nevertheless, explicit analytic
information often proves useful in electronic documents.</p>
<p>An especially useful analytic reference record is the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`AIN</span></tt>&#8216; record for
encoding instrumentation. This reference record follows a strict syntax. Each
instrument has an official Humdrum abbrevation. <a href="#id42"><span class="problematic" id="id43">`**Appendix II**`_</span></a> identifies
a number of the more common instrument codes. Instrumentation reference
records always specify the instrumentation in alphabetical order by
instrument abbrevation separated by a single space. For example, the
instrumentation for a woodwind quintet is given as:</p>
<p>`` !!!AIN: clars corno fagot flt oboe``</p>
<p>In our discussion here we have only identified some of the more common types
of reference records. A complete description of reference records is given in
Appendix II.</p>

<h2>Reprise<a class="headerlink" href="#reprise" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this chapter we have introduced the Humdrum <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">**kern</span></tt> representation and
a few of the more important reference records. As we have seen, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">**kern</span></tt>
can be used to encode core information for common musical scores; <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">**kern</span></tt>
is used to represent <em>functional</em> information rather than <em>orthographic</em>
(visual) information. In <a href="#id44"><span class="problematic" id="id45">`Chapter 6`_</span></a> an expanded description of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">**kern</span></tt>
will be given that includes a much wider variety of concepts and situations
than we have encountered in this chapter. <a href="#id46"><span class="problematic" id="id47">`**Appendices I**`_</span></a> and <a href="#id48"><span class="problematic" id="id49">`**II**`_</span></a>
provide expanded information pertaining to Reference Records.</p>
<p>Although we have only demonstrated the encoding of fairly simple information,
we can already begin processing such data in musically useful ways. In the
next chapter we will examine some simple processes.</p>
