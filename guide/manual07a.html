<h1>Representation Assumptions<a class="headerlink" href="#representation-assumptions" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>Three principle assumptions underly the Humdrum syntax. As with all design
assumptions, these principles inevitably act as limitations &#8211; circumscribing
what is possible.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The first assumption is that the information can be adequately
represented using discrete rather than continuous signifiers. This is a
limitation of all <em>symbolic</em> as opposed to <em>analogic</em> representations. If
continuous data (such as conducting gestures, or analog sound) are to be
represented using Humdrum, the data must be somehow transformed into a
discrete form.</li>
<li>The second assumption is that information can be meaningfully
organized as ordered successions of data tokens. More concretely, it is
assumed that data can be arranged in linear <em>spines,</em> and that these
spines are interpretable. This limitation implies that data tokens can be
meaningfully ordered. Normally, <em>time</em> (as in sequences of events), or
<em>space</em> (as in successive printed signs) provide suitable ordering
devices. However, events that are conceived as entirely independent of
one another are difficult to represent in Humdrum.</li>
<li>The third assumption is that the ASCII character set provides
sufficient richness to act as an appropriate set of signifiers. In
practice, this third assumption proves to be the most limiting. The use
of alphabetic and numeric characters is itself of little concern; as
Saussure pointed out, the choice of symbols is arbitary and conventional.
Of greater concern is the limitation of size. There are some 128
characters in the basic ASCII set &#8211; not all of them are printable.</li>
</ul>
<p>The size restriction imposed by the ASCII character set might be circumvented
by using binary, pictoral or other signifiers. However, there are currently
significant advantages to using ASCII signifiers. The principal advantage is
that many important software tools already exist for the manipulation of
ASCII text. The principal disadvantage of ASCII is addressed in Humdrum by
allowing users to recycle the ASCII characters an indefinite number of times
&#8211; through the use of new exclusive interpretations. Note that if all
representation schemes use ASCII signifiers, then any software tool developed
for the manipulation of ASCII text can be applied immediately to any Humdrum
representation. This approach discourages the explosive proliferation of
specialized software (each dealing with a unique representation), and
encourages users to rely on a smaller toolkit consisting of more generalized
and flexible tools. More precisely, this approach reduces the demands for
software development while maximizing the range of tasks to which a user&#8217;s
skills may be applied.</p>
<p>An alternative to Humdrum&#8217;s provision for multiple representations would be
to provide a single representation, with greater contextual constraints on
the positioning of signifiers. Unfortunately, high levels of context
dependency end up placing an inordinate burden on software development and
use. Humdrum attempts to simplify software development by minimizing as much
as possible context-dependent meanings for signifiers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-new-humdrum-representations">
<h1>Creating New Humdrum Representations<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-new-humdrum-representations" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>The Humdrum syntax provides a framework within which different music-related
symbol-systems can be defined. Each symbol system or representation <em>scheme</em>
is denoted by a unique <em>exclusive interpretation.</em> There is no restriction on
the number of schemes that can be used or created within Humdrum. Humdrum
users are consequently free to design new representation schemes that address
various needs.</p>
<p>Many newly created representation schemes are apt to be <em>user-specific</em> &#8211;
ways of organizing or representing information that are not likely to be of
much value to other Humdrum users. In other cases, a well crafted
representation scheme will prove to be of benefit to a wider community of
users. Whether a new Humdrum representation scheme is intended for private
use or for public distribution, it is prudent to develope good design habits.
There is no such thing as a &#8220;perfect&#8221; representation, but it is possible to
distinguish poor representations from better representations.</p>
<p>There are a number of considerations involved in the lucid design of a
Humdrum interpretation. In general, the procedures involved in representation
design can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Identify as clearly as possible the goal or goals you hope to achieve
using this new representation. Formulate a list of questions you expect
to be able to answer or address.</li>
<li>Create a list of the <em>essential signifieds</em> (concepts to be
represented) that are needed to pursue the goal(s).</li>
<li>Make a supplementary list of <em>related signifieds</em> that seem
peripheral to the immediate goal(s), but might prove important in
pursuing related goals.</li>
<li>By examining the lists of essential and related signifieds, try to
identify and define the <em>class</em> or <em>classes</em> of information with which
you are dealing.</li>
<li>Identify whether the signifieds of immediate interest belong together
in a single representation, or whether they ought to be split into two or
more Humdrum interpretations.</li>
<li>Having established a clearer understanding of the class of
signifieds, trim the previous lists of signifieds to a single list.</li>
<li>Identify those signifieds that may take many variant forms (as, for
example, musical ornament symbols). Determine whether these variant forms
are <em>finite, infinite</em> or <em>unknown</em> in number. If the number is infinite
or unknown, a single signifier should be used &#8211; with provision for an
auxilliary representation that can be used to identify the specific
variant form.</li>
<li>Assign signifiers to all signifieds using the supply of available
ASCII characters. In general, assign only a single character for each
signified. Using individual ASCII characters as signifiers helps
eliminates context dependency, and so reduces the complexity of the
software needed to process the representation.</li>
<li>In assigning signifiers to signifieds, try to avoid English language
initialisms (such as Q for quarter-note), since these mappings are poor
mnemonics for non-English-speaking users.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of the &#8220;do&#8217;s&#8221; and &#8220;dont&#8217;s&#8221; of designing a Humdrum interpretation can be
illustrated by considering a hypothetical representation problem. Below, we
consider how to design a representation for keyboard fingering.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="defining-a-new-humdrum-interpretation-a-sample-problem">
<h1>Defining a New Humdrum Interpretation: A Sample Problem<a class="headerlink" href="#defining-a-new-humdrum-interpretation-a-sample-problem" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>Suppose that we are interested in providing a comprehensive representation
scheme for fingering keyboard instruments. More concretely, let&#8217;s suppose
that we are interested in studying the degree of performance difficulty for
various keyboard works. Our <em>goal</em> might be to compare the relative
difficulty of works by different composers, or whether a given musical
arrangement is easier to perform than another arrangement. We might imagine,
for example, writing a program which, given some knowledge of performance
constraints, could accept fingering information as input and produce as
output an index of the degree of difficulty. At a later stage, we might
imagine creating an &#8220;intelligent&#8221; fingering program that could be used to
determine an optimum way of fingering a particular keyboard passage. (Such a
program might even be designed to take into account the unique physiological
abilities, constraints, or preferences of a given performer.) In summary, our
first research goal would use our &#8220;fingering&#8221; representation as an input to
some analysis program, whereas our second research goal might produce the
&#8220;fingering&#8221; representation as output.</p>
<p>Having identified the above goals, our next task is to identify the
<em>essential signifieds</em> that would be needed to solve these problems. The most
basic information we want to represent includes:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The identity of the finger and hand used in each key-press.</li>
<li>The identify of the key used in each key-press.</li>
<li>The order or sequence of key-presses.</li>
<li>The timing of each activity or movement.</li>
</ol>
<p>Having identified what we see as the essential signifieds, we ought to pause
and consider related signifieds that, although they appear to be peripheral
to our goals, might prove important in pursuing related goals. By thinking
ahead about these other signifieds, we might avoid future difficulties should
we discover that another item of information proves crucial to our
enterprise.</p>
<p>Some potential properties or attributes that we might consider representing
could include the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The force or velocity with which the key is pressed.</li>
<li>Whether the hands are crossed &#8211; and if so, which arm is placed above
the other.</li>
<li>What part of the finger/hand is used to press the key (e.g.
knuckles).</li>
<li>Whether more than one finger is used to press the same key together.</li>
<li>Whether one (or more) finger is substituted for another finger in the
course of holding a depressed key.</li>
<li>Whether trills are notated as a precise sequence of finger presses,
or whether they are recorded as generic &#8220;trills.&#8221;</li>
<li>Whether &#8220;Bebung&#8221; is used &#8211; that is, whether lateral or vertical
pressure is applied once the key is depressed.</li>
<li>Whether a second performer can be accommodated (as in the case of a
piano duet).</li>
<li>Physiological or anatomical attributes of the performer (such as
hand-spans).</li>
<li>Pedalling.</li>
</ol>
<p>A list of related signifieds is rarely likely to be exhaustive or complete.
So it is important to take time to consider other possible types of
information that relate to keyboard fingering.</p>
<p>In the initial stages of designing a Humdrum representation, it is generally
wise to try to formulate a fairly exhaustive list of possible pertinent
attributes. The purpose of such a list is to ensure that an informed decision
is made regarding those properties we wish to include in the representation,
and those properties we propose to exclude. More specifically, our goal is to
exclude information on the basis of an explicit decision rather than due to a
tacit oversight.</p>
<p>Given the above list of potential signifieds, the next step is to pause and
consider the nature of the <em>class</em> of information we wish to deal with. For
example, the idea of &#8220;pedalling&#8221; raises an interesting representation
question. Are we trying to represent keyboard <em>fingering?</em> Or is our task the
representation of keyboard <em>performance</em>? Pedalling is obviously part of
keyboard performance, but not something fingers do. Are we mistaken in
thinking that our representation task is limited to fingering? Also, since
larger arm and body movements are essential aspects of good performance,
should we also consider representing these additional factors?</p>
<p>In light of our goal of measuring performance difficulty, we would have to
admit that pedalling can indeed contribute to the physical challenge arising
from performing a given work. In terms of our research task therefore, it
makes sense to include pedalling information. However, we might balk at the
prospect of mixing fingering and pedalling within a single representation &#8211;
especially since some keyboard instruments (e.g. clavichord) have no pedals.
Moreover, the pedals on a piano differ considerably from the pedals on an
organ, although both contribute to overall performance difficulty.</p>
<p>At this point, we are invited to consider whether the various signifieds in
the above list truly belong together in a single <em>representation,</em> or whether
they ought to be split into two or more Humdrum interpretations. The above
discussion suggests that we might distinguish at least five classes of
information: <em>performance (broadly construed), fingering, body movement,
pedal-boarding</em> (as on the organ), and <em>pedalling</em> (as on the piano or
harpsichord). Moreover, we might define &#8220;performance information&#8221; as the
combination of fingering plus pedalling or pedal-boarding. In short, it would
make sense to define <em>three</em> representations: fingering, pedalling, and
pedal-boarding, and to assume that our program measuring performance
difficulty will accept any combination of one or more of these three classes
of information.</p>
<p>Our task has clearly expanded somewhat, since now we need to consider three
types of representation rather than one. For the purposes of this tutorial
example, we might set aside the problems of representing pedalling and pedal-
boarding and focus on the fingering aspect of keyboard performance.</p>
<p>Now that we have a clearer understanding of the class of signifieds, we can
begin to trim the lists of signifieds to a single short list. We have decided
not to represent pedalling using the same Humdrum interpretation as for
fingering. We might also decide that the fingering activity for a second
performer can be represented using a second independent spine of information.
We might also dispense with representing the force or velocity of key-
depression, and what part of the finger/hand is used to press the key. We
might have decided to represent the fingering for trills, but not to encode
each key-stroke of the trill separately. We could also decide that
representing physiological attributes of the performer (such as hand-spans)
ought to be left as a separate representation. Finally, we might have also
decided not to represent <em>Bebung.</em> This leaves a trimmed list of eight types
of signifieds:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">

<p>Before going on to map signifiers and signifieds we need to consider those
signifieds that may take variant forms. What sort of &#8220;variations&#8221; might
appear in a fingering representation? An obvious form of variation occurs
when alternative fingerings are possible &#8211; that is, where a passage contains
two (or more) ways of assigning key-presses to different fingers. Our first
task here is to determine whether the number of variant forms is finite,
infinite, or unknown in number. We can consider this question both at the
level of the individual key-press, and at the level of the entire work. In
the case of the individual key-press, the maximum number of variants is ten
&#8211; since there are no more than ten fingers. If more than one finger is used
to press a key, or if finger-substitutions occur, then the maximum number of
variants is somewhat more than ten &#8211; although still finite in number. At the
level of the entire work, the maximum number of variants is potentially very
large (at least 10 X the total number of key-presses in the work).
Nevertheless, this number remains a finite value for works of finite length.
The question arises, do we want our fingering representation to represent a
single performance of a keyboard passage, or is the representation intended
to represent alternative forms of performance?</p>
<p>In order to answer this question we must return once again to our initial
goals. In analysing the degree of performance difficulty for a work, we might
prefer to analyse a single (actual or plausible) performance. Measuring the
degree of performance difficulty for a <em>class</em> of variant performances is apt
to prove difficult. On the other hand, the musical score for a keyboard work
may contain no fingering indications whatsoever. Therefore it would be wrong
to assume that a single fingering specification would give an accurate
indication of the performance difficulty for a given musical work. This
raises the question of whether our intention is to measure the performance
difficulty of a specific sequence of key-presses used in a performance, or
whether our intention is to measure the performance difficulty of a
particular musical work.</p>
<p>As noted above, measuring the difficulty for a class of variant performances
is likely to prove difficult. There are many many ways of fingering a
keyboard work. Averaging the performance difficulty for the complete class of
possible fingering arrangements would appear silly since most of these
fingerings would be awkward. One could argue, for example, that the degree of
performance difficulty for a work can be best established by analysing the
single most convenient way of fingering the work. Alternatively, one could
argue that the degree of performance difficulty for a work can be determined
by examining a handful of the most convenient ways of fingering the work. Out
of the large number of <em>possible</em> fingerings, it is only the <em>plausible</em>
fingerings that really count.</p>
<p>Whether our intention is to measure a single fingering sequence or a class of
such fingerings, a helpful question to consider here is where do we expect to
get our fingering data? Three sources come to mind: (1) recorded fingering
data from an actual performance, (2) fingerings (including alternatives)
notated in printed scores or annotated by keyboard performers, and (3)
fingering data (including alternatives) generated by a computer program. In
the case of an actual performance, there will be only one fingering. The
other sources can potentially produce more than one fingering at a time.</p>
<p>Having identified those attributes that we wish to represent, we need to
consider how the representation ought to be structured. Specifically, we need
to consider how our fingering representation can be coordinated with other
Humdrum interpretations. The most important coordination task is ensuring
that our representation will correspond well with the core <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">**kern</span></tt>
representation. Each data record in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">**kern</span></tt> represents a single sonority
&#8211; a moment in time that differs from the previous state. Since key-presses
are closely related to notes, we might want to coordinate each of the
`` <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">**</span></a>kern`` note tokens with possible key-presses. Many Humdrum pitch-related
representations include barlines &#8211; which are useful markers for coordinating
such representations. This suggests that it might be useful to include
barlines in our fingering representation. Given both the barline and note-
token/key-press correspondences, we should have little difficulty ensuring
that our fingering representation will be fully coordinated with a number of
other Humdrum representations.</p>
<p>We are now ready to consider how to map our signifieds with a set of
appropriate signifiers. In general, we should endeavor to define one
signifier for each attribute. First, consider how we might identify the
individual fingers. A good system would be to identify each finger by a
unique signifier &#8211; such as a unique decimal integer. However, there is a
long-standing tradition of identifying the thumb of each hand as the number
&#8220;1&#8221;, the index finger by the number &#8220;2&#8221; and so on. Given the limited number
of fingers, some context-dependency may be appropriate here. In short, we may
decide to identify specific fingers through a <em>ligature</em> of &#8220;hand+finger&#8221; &#8211;
e.g. left-3 or right-5. The signifiers &#8220;left&#8221; and &#8220;right&#8221; obviously introduce
an English bias. It would be better to consider more universally recognized
terms such as &#8220;mano destra&#8221; (MD) and &#8220;mano sinistra&#8221; (MS). However, not every
user will find these is terms familiar or comfortable.</p>
<p>We need not rely on a literalism or initialism. &#8220;Left&#8221; and &#8220;right&#8221; are
concepts that lend themselves well to pictorial representation, so we might
consider using those ASCII characters that convey a left-right pictorial
dimension. Possible contenders would include various letter-contrasts: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">d</span></tt>
versus <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">J</span></tt> versus <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">L</span></tt>; the three types of parentheses: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">(</span></tt>
versus <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">)</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">{</span></tt> versus <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">}</span></tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[</span></tt> versus <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">]</span></tt>; and the greater-
than and less-than signs: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;</span></tt> versus <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&gt;</span></tt>. The letter contrasts <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">J</span></tt>
versus <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">L</span></tt> are especially poor since although the angle of the letter
`` L```` is drawn to the right, &#8220;L&#8221; implies an initialism for &#8220;left&#8221; &#8211; and so
is apt to cause confusion. The parentheses cannot be misconstrued as
literalisms or initialisms, so they are somewhat better signifiers. However
the greater-than and less-than signs are the mostly clearly arrow-like, and
so perhaps provide a better pair of left-right signifiers.</p>
<p>Having decided upon the signifiers for left and right, and having adopted the
tradition of numbering the fingers (1=thumb, 2=index, 3=middle, 4=ring,
5=little), we could continue mapping signifiers to signifieds, taking care to
minimize context dependency.</p>
<p>In reflecting on the above discussion, readers are apt to feel that one or
another type of information ought to have been included, or that the
signifiers ought to be assigned in a different manner. Since Humdrum provides
a framework within which alternative representation schemes can be designed,
there is no need to defend a given representation from competing schemes.
Whether an interpretation survives and proliferates will be determined, not
by its conceptual elegance or completeness, but by whether it is found to
have a practical utility in solving users&#8217; problems.</p>
