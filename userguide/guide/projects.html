<li>Since its public release in 1993, the Humdrum Toolkit has been adopted by</li>
</ul>
<p>musicologists pursuing a wide variety of research interests. Innumerable
scholarly projects have relied on Humdrum, and at least three dozen published
articles have resulted. Here are a few discoveries that scholars have been
made using the <strong>Humdrum Toolkit</strong>. *</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="#Collins">Zarlino&#8217;s Rules for Cantus Firmus Canons</a> <a class="reference external" href="#Nam">Traditional Korean Scales</a>

<p>Dr. Denis Collins of Stanford University used the Humdrum Toolkit to compare
canonic compositional rules by Zarlino, Berardi, and Nanino. Collins studied
how well the canonic practice actually conforms to the different theoretical
prescriptions. He found that, although Berardi&#8217;s and Nanino&#8217;s rules were
extensions to Zarlino&#8217;s work, Zarlino&#8217;s original rules provided more succinct
and more precise descriptions of the canonic repertoire.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Nam Unjung from the University of Hawaii at Manoa used Humdrum to examine
scale systems in Korean court music. Using a repertoire of recorded <em>p&#8217;iri</em>
music, Nam was able to represent pitches both according to the traditional
Korean designations as well as using frequency and cents. She used Humdrum to
establish which works were performed in different modes and which were
performed using different tunings.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Dr. Matthew Royal of the University of Western Ontario used the Humdrum
Toolkit to investigate the relationship between melodic accent and
syllable/mellismatic text relationships in Gregorian chant. He found evidence
that the chant literature is <em>not</em> organized in a way consistent with
rhythmic or metric performance.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Jonathan Berec of the University of Waterloo used Humdrum to investigate
idiomaticism in trumpet and cornet works written by virtuoso performers and
non-trumpet players. Using a model of performance mechanics, Berec was able
to identify those works which are most idiomatic to the instrument.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Dr. Andreas Kornstadt of the University of Hamburg created a music analysis
application that allows musicologists and theorists to do sophisticated
&#8220;mark-up&#8221; of scores, such as Leitmotivic analysis of Wagner operas. A notable
feature of <em>JRing</em> is the intuitive graphic user interface which replicates
an &#8220;analytic desktop&#8221;. Humdrum is used as the underlying analytic engine.
<a class="reference external" href="Kornstaedt/jring.pdf">Further information is available.</a></p>

<p>The late Dr. Helmut Schaffrath of the University of Essen supervised the
encoding of thousands of European folksongs from ethnomusicological sources.
In 1995 Schaffrath&#8217;s database was translated to the Humdrum format. Averaging
successive pitches in thousands of phrases revealled a marked melodic arch
shape.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Sandra Serafini of the University of Washington used the Humdrum Toolkit to
investigate the effect of tempo on the organization of Haydn string quartets.
She found evidence consistent with Daniel Berlyne&#8217;s theory of optimum
complexity: as the tempo increases, rhythmic and harmonic complexity is
reduced.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Jasba Simpson of the Walt Disney <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">`</span></a>Imagineering&#8217; research center has used the
Humdrum Toolkit to create a two-dimensional &#8220;musical texture map.&#8221; Simpson
used a large database of existing works and showed how a computer algorithm
could be used to automatically classify the works as predominantly
monophonic, homophonic, or polyphonic in texture.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Dr. David Huron of the Ohio State University has used the Humdrum Toolkit to
investigate asymmetries in notated musical dynamics. For the vast majority of
composers, crescendos are more frequent and last longer than dimineundos. Of
the composers studied, Beethoven is the composer with the greatest dynamic
asymmetry. Carl Nielsen is the composer with the least dynamic asymmetry.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Dr. Mark Dewitt of the University of California, Berkeley is using the
Humdrum Toolkit to investigate how the melodic and harmonic organization of
Cajun music has been influenced by the button accordian. Dewitt is able to
encode his own accordian tablature transcriptions directly into Humdrum.</p>
