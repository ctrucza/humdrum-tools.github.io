Chapter 26: Moving Signifiers Between Spines
================================================


In many types of tasks is it useful to be able to transfer signifiers from
one spine to another. In this chapter we will discuss two commands. The
`**rend**`_ command makes it possible to split characters in a single spine
and distribute them across two or more spines. The `**cleave**`_ command does
the reverse: it allows characters that are distributed across two or more
spines to be gathered into a single new spine. These two commands provide
opportunities to create Humdrum spines that contain precisely the information
of interest to the user.


The *rend* Command
--------

The `**rend**`_ command allows a Humdrum spine to be broken apart into two or
more spines. Different pieces of information can be distributed to the
individual output spines. Consider for example the following spine containing
``**pitch``_ data:



``**pitch
> Ab3
> F#4
> C5
> *-``

The **rend** command might be used to structure this as three independent
spines:



``**octave**note**accidental
> 3Abb
> 4F##
> 5C.
> *-*-*-``

The operation of `**rend**`_ requires a reassignment file where each line
contains an output exclusive interpretation, followed by a tab, followed by a
regular expression. In the above case, the reassignment file (``reassign``)
contained the following:

``**octave[0-9]
> **note[A-Gb#x]
> **accidental[b#x]``

The first line tells **rend** that any signifiers matching the character-
class 0-9 should be output in a spine labelled ``**octave``. The second line
causes signifiers matching the upper-case letters A to G and the ``b``, ``#``
and ``x`` signifiers to be output in a spine labelled ``**note``. The third
line causes signifiers matching just ``b``, ``#`` and ``x`` to be output in a
spine labelled ``**accidental``.

The above output was generated by invoking the following command:

``rend -i '**pitch' -f reassign`` *inputfile*

Note that the **-i** and **-f** options are mandatory. The **-i** option
tells `**rend**`_ which input spines to process and the **-f** option tells
**rend** the name of the file containing the spine-reassignments.

The **rend** command is typically paired with a subsequent **cleave**
command.


The *cleave* Command
--------

The `**cleave**`_ command amalgamates concurrent data tokens in two or more
spines into a single data spine. In effect, **cleave** does the opposite of
`**rend**`_. By way of example, **cleave** can be used to transform the
following:

``**A**B**C
> abc
> ABC
> *-*-*-``

into:

``**new
> abc
> ABC
> *-``

Specifically, the above "cleaving" would be done using the following command:

``cleave -i '**A,**B,**C' -o '**new'`` *inputfile*

Both the **-i** and **-o** options are mandatory. The **-i** option tells
`**cleave**`_ which exclusive interpretations should be cleaved together. In
the above case, we have provided a list of three types of data. The **-o**
option tells `**cleave**`_ what to call the resulting cleaved spine. In this
case, we've simply called the result ``**new``.

Suppose that we would like to automatically add key-velocities to some
``**MIDI``_ data that reflect the normal accents arising from the meter.
For example, in 4/4 meter, we would like the first note in each measure to be
strongest, the third beat to be next most strongest and so on. Recall that
``**MIDI`` data tokens consist of three elements: (1) the duration in MIDI
clock ticks, (2) the key number (also on/off indication), and (3) the key
velocity. In order to add accents, we need to change the key velocity values.
The maximum MIDI key velocity value is 127; the minimum value is 0; and the
default value is 64.

Consider the following hypothetical input file:

``**kern
> *M4/4
> =1-
> 4c
> 8d
> 8e
> 8f
> 8g
> 8a
> 8b
> =2
> 2cc
> *-``

The `**metpos**`_ command can be used to identify the metric position of
various note onsets. Before using **metpos** however, we must use the
`**timebase**`_ command to create an isorhythmic record structure. Since the
shortest note is an eighth-note, the appropriate command is as follows.

``timebase -t 8 scale > scale.tb``

Using the timebased output, we can then invoke the **metpos** command:

``metpos scale.tb > scale.met``

The resulting output contains both the original input (on the left) and the
metric position spine (on the right):

``**kern**metpos
> *M4/4*M4/4
> *tb8*tb8
> =1-=1-
> 4c1
> .4
> 8d3
> 8e4
> 8f2
> 8g4
> 8a3
> 8b4
> =2=2
> 2cc1
> .4
> .3
> .4
> *-*-``

Let's now eliminate the null data tokens introduced by **timebase**. Using
`**humsed**`_, we delete each data record beginning with a period character:

``humsed '/^\./d' scale.met > scale.tmp``

Next, we can use the `**recode**`_ command to change the metric position
values to appropriate MIDI key velocities. We might use the following
reassignment file (named ``accent``):

> ==1100
> ==280
> ==360
> ==440
> elseerror

In applying **recode** we will take care to avoid processing measure numbers
using the **-s** (skip) option:

``recode -f accent -s ^= -i '**metpos' scale.tmp > scale.acc``

The output will now appear as follows:

``**kern**metpos
> *M4/4*M4/4
> *tb8*tb8
> =1-=1-
> 4c100
> 8d60
> 8e40
> 8f80
> 8g40
> 8a60
> 8b40
> =2=2
> 2cc100
> *-*-``

Now we can use the `**midi**`_ command to generate ``**MIDI`` data:

``midi scale.acc > scale.mid``

The result is given below:

``**MIDI**metpos
> *Ch1*
> *M4/4*M4/4
> *tb8*tb8
> =1-=1-
> 72/60/64100
> 72/-60/64 72/62/6460
> 36/-62/64 36/64/6440
> 36/-64/64 36/65/6480
> 36/-65/64 36/67/6440
> 36/-67/64 36/69/6460
> 36/-69/64 36/71/6440
> =2=2
> 36/-71/64 36/72/64100
> 144/-72/64.
> *-*-``

Before using `**cleave**`_ to join the new key velocity values to the
``**MIDI`` data we need to delete the current key-down velocities. These are
the values `64' preceding the tab character. The `**humsed**`_ command can be
used as follows:

``humsed 's/64``*tab*/*tab*``/' scale.mid > scale.tmp``

The modified output will now be:

``**MIDI**metpos
> *Ch1*
> *M4/4*M4/4
> *tb8*tb8
> =1-=1-
> 72/60/100
> 72/-60/64 72/62/60
> 36/-62/64 36/64/40
> 36/-64/64 36/65/80
> 36/-65/64 36/67/40
> 36/-67/64 36/69/60
> 36/-69/64 36/71/40
> =2=2
> 36/-71/64 36/72/100
> 144/-72/.
> *-*-``

Finally, we use `**cleave**`_ to add the new key-down velocities.

``cleave -i '**MIDI,**metpos' -o '**MIDI' scale.tmp > scale.mid``

The final output is:

``**MIDI
> *
> *M4/4
> *tb8
> =1-=1-
> 72/60/100
> 72/-60/64 72/62/60
> 36/-62/64 36/64/40
> 36/-64/64 36/65/80
> 36/-65/64 36/67/40
> 36/-67/64 36/69/60
> 36/-69/64 36/71/40
> =2=2
> 36/-71/64 36/72/100
> 144/-72/
> *-``


Creating Mixed Representations
------------------------------

For some analytic tasks it is often useful to generate a special
representation that combines all of the elements or types of data of interest
to the researcher. For example, suppose we were working on a model of melodic
organization that reduced melodies to three types of information: relative-
duration context, gross pitch height, and scale step. Sample data tokens for
our representation and their meanings are given in the following table.
Notice that the order of signifiers is important:



> **token**meaning**
``LSLHto``long-short-long rhythm, high pitch, tonic
``LLSLsd``long-long-short rhythm, low pitch, subdominant
``MLSMlt``medium-long-short rhythm, medium pitch, leading tone
``r``rest

In `Chapter 22`_ we learned how to use `**recode**`_ to classify various
numerical ranges and `**humsed**`_ to classify non-numeric data. We already
know how to create the elements of our new representation.

The scale degree information can be created by using `**deg**`_ and
**humsed** can be used to transform the signifiers as in the following
``degree`` file:

``s/1.*/to/
s/2.*/st/
s/3.*/me/
s/4.*/sd/
s/5.*/do/
s/6.*/sm/
s/7.*/lt/``

We can classify the pitch ranges into high, medium, and low using the
`**semits**`_ command, followed by **recode**. For example, we could
transform the ``**semits``_ data using the following reassignment file:

``<0L
> >16H
> >=0M
> elser``

Durations can be similarly classified into long (L), medium (M), and short
(S) using the `**dur**`_ command, followed by *recode*.

``>1.0L
> >0.5M
> >0S``

Using `**context**`_ **-n 3** we could then create contextual `triples' so
that data records contain three durations. Suppose also that we have used
**sed** to change the names of the exclusive interpretations so they are more
appropriate. As a result we have three spines that, when assembled together
are organized as in Example 26.1

**Example 26.1**

``**rhythm**range**scale-step
> L S LHto
> L L SLsd
> M L SMlt
> rrr
> *-*-*-``

We need to process the first spine with **humsed** again to eliminate the
spaces in the multiple stops. The rhythm spine would be processed as follows:

``humsed 's/ //g' rhythm > rhythm.new``

We could assemble these spines using the `**assemble**`_ command:

``assemble rhythm.new range scale.step > newfile``

Finally we can use **cleave** to amalgamate all of the data into a single
final spine.

``cleave -i '**rhythm,**range,**scale-step' -o '**complex' \
>
>> newfile > output``

Having created our new representation, we can continue to process this new
data with the various Humdrum tools. For example, we could generate
inventories that answer questions such as "How often does a high subdominant
note in a long-short-long rhythmic follow a low submediant in a long-long-
short context?

A similar approach can be used to address other questions, such as whether
large leaps involving chromatically-altered tones tend to have a longer
duration on the altered tone. Etc.

Reprise
-------

In this chapter we have seen how `**rend**`_ and `**cleave**`_ can be used to
take bits and pieces of signifiers from potentially many spines, and assemble
a composite Humdrum spine that contains precisely the information of
interest. Before amalgamating spines, you can use the `**humsed**`_ command
to translate the characters/signifiers so that you use your preferred way of
representing something.
