Chapter 3: Some Initial Processing
========================================


Now that we have learned some things about Humdrum representations (and the
\*\*kern representation in particular), let's explore some basic processing
tasks.


The *census* Command
-----------------------

The Humdrum |census|_ command provides basic information about an input
stream or file. We can invoke the command by typing the command name followed
by the name of a file. The command

``census india01.krn``

might produce the following output:

| HUMDRUM DATA
| Number of data tokens: 91
| Number of null tokens: 0
| Number of multiple-stops: 0
| Number of data records: 91
| Number of comments: 14
| Number of interpretations: 7
| Number of records: 112
|

Most commands provide *options* that will modify the operation of the command
in a particular way. In UNIX-style commands, options follow after the command
name and are typically specified by a single letter preceded by a hyphen. The
``-k`` option with the |census|_ command will give further information
pertaining to the Humdrum `**kern`representation. With the ``-k`` option,
the output includes the number of notes in the file, the longest, shortest,
highest, and lowest notes, the maximum number of concurrent notes or voices,
the number of rests, and the number of barlines. For example, the command:

``census -k india01.krn``

might produce the following *additional* output:

| KERN DATA
| Number of noteheads: 78
| Number of notes: 78
| Longest note: 1
| Shortest note: 16
| Highest note: cc
| Lowest note: c
| Number of rests: 1
| Maximum number of voices: 1
| Number of single barlines: 11
| Number of double barlines: 1
|

Notice that a distinction is made between the number of notes and the number
of noteheads. A tied note is considered to be a single "note," although it
may be notated using two or more noteheads.

The output from |census|_ can be restricted to a particular item of
information by "piping" the output to the UNIX `grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_ command.


Simple Searches using the *grep* Command
-------------------

The UNIX `grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_ command is a popular tool for searching for lines that
match some specified pattern. Patterns may be simple strings of characters,
or may be more complicated constructions defined using the UNIX *regular
expression* syntax. Regular expressions will be described in detail in
|Chapter 9|_\ . The command name "`grep`" is an acronym for "get regular
expression."

Useful patterns are often literal character strings, such as keywords. For
example, the following command identifies whether the file `opus28.krn`
contains the word "`Andante`":

``grep 'Andante' opus28.krn``

Every line containing the specified pattern will be output. If no match is
found, no output is given.

Using a single command, all files in the current directory can be searched by
substituting the asterisk (shell *wildcard*) in place of a filename. The
following command identifies all instances where the word "`Andante`"
occurs; all files in the current directory are searched:

``grep 'Andante' *``

Once again, every line containing the sought pattern is echoed in the output.
If more than one pattern is found, each instance of the pattern will be
output on a separate line. Whenever an asterisk or "wildcard" is used as part
of the filename, `grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_ causes the *name* of each file to be prepended to
the output for all patterns that are found:

| opus28:!! Andante
| opus29:!! Andante
| opus46:!! Andante
| opus91:!! Andante
| opus98:!! Andante
|

By default, `grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_ distinguishes upper- and lower-case characters, so the
above command will not match strings such as "`ANDANTE`". However, the
``-i`` option tells `grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_ to ignore the case when searching. E.g.,

``grep -i 'Andante' *``

Sought patterns may occur in any line, including data records and comments.
The following command will identify the presence of any double-sharps in the
file `schumann.krn`.

``grep '##' schumann.krn``


Pattern Locations Using grep -n
-------------------------------

If a pattern is found, it is sometimes helpful to know the precise location
of the pattern. The ``-n`` option tells `grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_ to prepend the *line number*
for each matching instance. The following command identifies the line numbers
for lines containing a double sharp for the file `melody.krn`:

``grep -n '##' melody.krn``

The output might look like this:

| 1109:{4g##
| 1731:16g##
| 3002:16f##
| 

-- meaning that double sharps were found in lines 1109, 1731, and 3002 in the
file `melody.krn`.


Counting Pattern Occurrences Using grep -c
------------------------------------------

In some cases, the user is interested in counting the total number of
instances of a found pattern. The ``-c`` option causes `grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_ to output a
numerical *count* of the number of lines containing matching instances. For
example, in the `**kern`representation, the beginning of each phrase is
marked by the presence of an open curly brace (``{`'). So the following
command can be used to count the number of phrases in the file
`glazunov.krn`:

``grep -c '{' glazunov.krn``

As noted, the `grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_ command will search all lines (including comments) for
matching instances of the specified pattern. If a curly brace were to appear
in a comment or other non-data record, then our phrase-count would be
incorrect. More carefully constructed patterns require a better knowledge of
*regular expressions.* Regular expressions are discussed in |Chapter 9|_\ .


Searching for Reference Information
-----------------------------------

As we saw in |Chapter 2|_\ , Humdrum files typically encode library-type
information using reference records. For example, the ``**composer's name**``_
is encoded in a ``!!!COM:`` record, and the ``**title**``_ is encoded via the
``!!!OTL:`` record. In conjunction with the `grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_ command, these three-
letter codes provide useful tags to search for pertinent information. For
example, the following command will identify the composer for the file
`opus24.krn`:

``grep '!!!COM:' opus24.krn``

The output might look like this:

``!!!COM: Boulanger, Nadia``

Once again, a wildcard (i.e., the asterisk) can be used to address all of the
files in the current directory. Hence the command

``grep '!!!COM:' *``

will produce a list of all composers of files in the current directory.
Similarly, the following command will generate a list of all of the titles:

``grep '!!!OTL:' *``

The output might look as follows:

| foster11:!!!OTL: Oh! Susanna
| foster12:!!!OTL: Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair
| foster13:!!!OTL: Beautiful Dreamer
| foster14:!!!OTL: Gwine to Run All Night (or 'De Camptown Race')
| foster15:!!!OTL: My Old Kentucky Home, Good-Night
| foster16:!!!OTL: We are Coming, Father Abraam
| foster17:!!!OTL: Don't Bet Your Money on De Shanghai
| foster18:!!!OTL: Gentle Annie
| foster19:!!!OTL: If You've Only Got a Moustache
| foster20:!!!OTL: Maggie by my Side
| foster21:!!!OTL: Old Folks at Home
| foster22:!!!OTL: Better Times are Coming
| foster23:!!!OTL: When this Dreadful War is Ended
| foster24:!!!OTL: Hard Times Comes Again No More
|

Remember that when a wildcard is used in filenames, `grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_ prepends the
filename prior to found patterns. These filename `headers' can be eliminated
by selecting the ``-h`` option for `grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_:

``grep -h '!!!OTL:' *``

(N.B. Some older versions of `grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_ do not support all of the options
described here. Filename headers can be stripped from the output by using the
UNIX `sed <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed>`_ command described in |Chapter 14|_\ .)

We might place the resulting list of titles in a separate file using the UNIX
*file redirection* construction. The output of a command can be placed into a
file by following the command with a greater-than sign (>) followed by a
filename. For example, the following command places the output from `grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_
in a file called `titles`:

``grep -h '!!!OTL:' * > titles``

Beware that if the file titles already exists then it will be over
written and its previous contents lost. With the ``-h`` option the file
titles might contain the following lines:

| !!!OTL: Oh! Susanna
| !!!OTL: Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair
| !!!OTL: Beautiful Dreamer
| !!!OTL: Gwine to Run All Night (or 'De Camptown Race')
| !!!OTL: My Old Kentucky Home, Good-Night
| !!!OTL: We are Coming, Father Abraam
| !!!OTL: Don't Bet Your Money on De Shanghai
| !!!OTL: Gentle Annie
| !!!OTL: If You've Only Got a Moustache
| !!!OTL: Maggie by my Side
| !!!OTL: Old Folks at Home
| !!!OTL: Better Times are Coming
| !!!OTL: When this Dreadful War is Ended
| !!!OTL: Hard Times Comes Again No More
|

The *sort* Command
-------------------

The UNIX operating system provides a general sorting utility called**sort**.
We might use this utility to rearrange the titles in alphabetical order:

``sort titles``

Rather than using an intermediate file, we can directly connect the `grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_
and**sort**commands using a UNIX "pipe." The vertical bar (`|`) creates a
connection between the output of one command and the input of the next
command. We can combine the above two commands to create an alphabetical
listing of all titles in the current directory:

``grep '!!!OTL:' * | sort``

File redirection can be added at the end of a pipe so the final output is
captured in a file. In the following case, the alphabetized titles are placed
in the file `titles`:

``grep '!!!OTL:' * | sort > titles``


The *uniq* Command
-------------------

Bach often harmonized a chorale melody more than once. In the 185 chorales in
the original 1784 edition, several duplicate titles are present. Suppose you
want to create an alphabetical list of titles, but you want to exclude
duplicate titles. The UNIX `uniq <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniq>`_ command provides a useful utility for
eliminating duplication. Without any option, `uniq <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniq>`_ simply eliminates any
successive repeated lines. For example, given the input:

| 1
| 1 
| 1
| 2
| 2
| 3 
|

the `uniq <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniq>`_ command will produce the following output:

| 1
| 2
| 3
|

Note that `uniq <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniq>`_ only discards *successive* repeated records; an input such
as the following would remain unmodified by the `uniq <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniq>`_ command:

| 1
| 2
| 3
| 1
| 3
| 1
|

Another important point about `uniq <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniq>`_ is that successive lines must be
*exact repetitions* in order to be discarded. For example, if one line has a
trailing blank that is not present in the previous line, then the line is not
discarded.

Returning to our problem of creating a list of unique titles for J.S. Bach's
chorale harmonizations, we can use the following command pipeline.

``grep -h '!!!OTL:' * | sort | uniq``

Note that our "pipeline" consists of three successive commands with the
outputs connected to the inputs using the UNIX pipe symbol (`|`). The**sort**command is essential in order to collect identical titles as
successive lines before passing the list to `uniq <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniq>`_.

Suppose you wanted to ensure that all of the works in the current directory
are composed by the same composer. The same command structure can be used,
only we would search for reference records encoding the composer's name:

``grep -h '!!!COM:' * | sort | uniq``

Even if the current directory contains hundreds of works by one composer (say
Beethoven) and just a single work by another composer, the presence of the
odd score will be obvious without having to look through long lists:

| !!!COM: Beethoven, Ludwig van
| !!!COM: Stamitz, Carl Philipp

Of course we can make similar lists for other types of information available
in reference records. The ``AIN`` reference record encodes instrumentation.
We could make a list of various instrumental combinations used for scores in
the current directory:

``grep -h '!!!AIN:' * | sort | uniq``


Options for the *uniq* Command
-------------------

Like `grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_, the `uniq <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniq>`_ command provides several options that modify its
behavior. The ``-d`` option causes only those records to be output which are
*duplicated* (i.e. two or more instances). Conversely, the ``-u`` option
causes only those records to be output that are truly *unique* (i.e. only a
single instance is present in the input).

Suppose, for example, that we want to know which of the Bach chorales are
harmonizations of the same tunes -- that is, have the same titles. (Of course
the same chorale might be known by two or more titles, but let's defer this
problem until |Chapter 25|_\ .) The ``-d`` option will only output the
duplicate records:

``grep -h '!!!OTL:' * | sort | uniq -d``

The output will identify those titles which appear in two or more files in
the current directory. The output might look as follows:

| !!!OTL: Befiehl du deine Wege
| !!!OTL: Christ lag in Todesbanden
| !!!OTL: Christus, der ist mein Leben
| !!!OTL: Das alte Jahr vergangen ist
| !!!OTL: Ein' feste Burg ist unser Gott
| !!!OTL: Erbarm' dich mein, o Herre Gott
| !!!OTL: Herr, ich habe missgehandelt
| !!!OTL: Herr, wie du willst, so schick's mit mir
| !!!OTL: Ich dank' dir, lieber Herre
| !!!OTL: Jesu, der du meine Seele
| !!!OTL: Jesu, meiner Seelen Wonne
|

Having established which titles are duplicates, a logical next step might be
to identify the specific files involved. We can use `grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_ again to search
for a specific title. Without the ``-h`` option, the output will identify the
appropriate filenames. For example:

``grep '!!!OTL: Befiehl du deine Wege' *``

might produce the following output:

| bwv270.krn:!!!OTL: Befiehl du deine Wege
| bwv271.krn:!!!OTL: Befiehl du deine Wege
| bwv272.krn:!!!OTL: Befiehl du deine Wege
|

Sometimes we would like to have an output that contains *only* the
*filenames* containing the sought pattern. The ``-l`` option causes `grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_
to output only filenames that contain one or more instances of the sought
pattern:

``grep -l '!!!OTL: Befiehl du deine Wege' *``

The output would appear as follows:

| bwv270.krn
| bwv271.krn
| bwv272.krn
|

As we've already notes, the ``-u`` option for `uniq <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniq>`_ causes only unique
entries in a list to be passed to the output. This is often useful in
identifying works that differ in some way from other works in a group or
corpus. For example, in some repertory, you may remember that a particular
work had a different instrumentation than the other works. But you may not be
able to remember what the specific instrumentation was. Use the ``-u`` option
for `uniq <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniq>`_ to produce a list consisting of only those works whose
instrumentation differs from all others:

``grep -h '!!!AIN:' * | sort | uniq -u``

As in the case of the `grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_ command, `uniq <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniq>`_ also supports a ``-c``
option which counts the number of occurrences of a pattern. For example, if
we want to count the number of works by each composer in the current
directory:

``grep -h '!!!OTL:' * | sort | uniq -c``

The output might appear as follows:

| 9 !!!COM: Berardi, Angelo
| 2 !!!COM: Caldara, Antonio
| 12 !!!COM: Zarlino, Gioseffo
| 2 !!!COM: Sweelinck, Jan Pieterszoon
| 4 !!!COM: Josquin Des Pres
|

Notice that the number of instances is prepended to the reference records.

Incidentally, if we wanted to rearrange this list in order of the number of
works, we could pass the above output to yet another**sort**command. Since**sort**sorts from left to right, it will begin sorting according to the
numerical values at the extreme left. The command

``grep -h '!!!COM:' * | sort | uniq -c | sort -n``

will rearrange the above output as follows:

| 2 !!!COM: Caldara, Antonio
| 2 !!!COM: Sweelinck, Jan Pieterszoon
| 4 !!!COM: Josquin Des Pres
| 9 !!!COM: Berardi, Angelo
| 12 !!!COM: Zarlino, Gioseffo
|

It is important to understand that the two**sort**commands in our pipeline
achieve different goals but use the same process. The first**sort**command
sorts the composer's names into alphabetical order. This is done so that the
ensuing `uniq <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniq>`_ command is able to count successive identical records. Since
the **uniq -c** command prepends numerical counts, the subsequent**sort**sorts first according to the numbers to the left of the reference records.

As a final note, we might mention that, like `grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_ and `uniq <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniq>`_, the**sort**command has several options. One option, the ``-r`` option, causes
the output to be arranged in reverse order. This can be useful in producing
lists that are ordered from most common to least common.


Reprise
------------------

In this chapter we have introduced some elementary ways of processing Humdrum
files. We noted that the |census|_ command can be used to identify basic
statistics about a file. The ``-k`` option for |census|_ provides basic
information related to `**kern`files, such as the number of notes and
rests, the highest and lowest notes, the number of barlines, etc.

In this chapter we also introduced simple searching techniques using the
`grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_ command; `grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_ provides a useful way of locating particular
patterns of text characters in files. We used `grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_ to identify composers,
titles, instrumentation and other information. Most of our examples were
limited to searching for Humdrum reference records. In later chapters we will
use `grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_ in more sophisticated searches. We noted several useful options
for `grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_: the ``-c`` option causes a count to be output of the number of
instances of the pattern in each file. The ``-i`` option causes `grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_ to
ignore any distinction between upper- and lower-case characters when
searching for patterns. The ``-h`` option causes `grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_ to suppress
outputting the filenames prior to found patterns when more than one file is
searched. The ``-l`` option results in only the filenames being output. In a
later chapter we will encounter a number of other useful options provided by
`grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_.

Also discussed in this chapter was the `uniq <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniq>`_ command; `uniq <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniq>`_ provides a
useful utility for eliminating or isolating duplicate records or lines. Once
again a number of useful options were introduced. The ``-c`` option causes
`uniq <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniq>`_ to prepend a count of the number of duplicate input lines. The
``-d`` option results in only duplicate input lines being noted in the
output. The ``-u`` option does the reverse: only those input lines that are
unique are passed to the output.

Finally, we introduced the UNIX**sort**utility. This command rearranges the
order of successive input lines so they are in alphabetic/numeric order. The**sort**command provides a wealth of useful options; however, we mentioned
only the ``-r`` option -- which causes the output to be sorted in reverse
order.
