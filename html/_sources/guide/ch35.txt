Chapter 35: Layers
====================

In `Chapters 11`_ and `15`_ we examined different kinds of intervals,
including both harmonic and melodic intervals. A number of different types of
intervals were distinguished and we learned how to calculate such intervals.
One type of melodic interval mentioned in `Chapter 11`_ is the *distance
interval* -- an interval between pitches which are separated by intervening
musical materials. In this chapter we consider more sophisticated ways of
determining distance intervals. These types of intervals are the foundation
of various notions of hierarchies or "layers" of pitch analysis.

This chapter also visits a related issue of implied harmony. Many melodic
passages outline clear harmonic progressions which are also implicated in
layer-related analyses.


Implied Harmony
---------------

Example 35.1 shows a two-phrase trumpet solo from Aaron Copland's *El Salon
Mexico*. Harmonic progressions may be evident only when arpeggiated figures
are collapsed. In this case, an implicit harmony may is evident where a G
major chord is followed by a D dominant seventh chord. The barlines provide
convenient ways of parsing the harmonies.

**Example 35.1** Aaron Copland, *El Salon Mexico*.

A \*\*kern_ encoding of the passage is given below:

``!!!COM: Copland, A.
``!!!OTL: El Salon Mexico
``**kern
``*Itromp
``*clefG2
``*k[]
``*M4/4
``=29
``2r

``8ff#}~
``8r
``4r
``2r;

``*-``

We can collapse the arpeggiated chords using the **context** command:

``context -b = -o = copland``

Identify the chords is facilitated by using the pitch-class (``**pc``_)
representation described in `Chapter 34.`_

``context -b = -o = copland | pc -a | rid -d``

The corresponding output is:

``!!!COM: Copland, A.
``!!!OTL: El Salon Mexico
``**pc
``*Itromp
``*clefG2
``*k[]
``*M4/4
``2 B 2 B 2 B 2 B 2 7 2 B 7
``0 9 9 2 6 9
``0 9 6 2 2 2
``6 r r r
``*-``

In order to identify these as G major and D dominant chords it would be
convenient to reduce the sets to (2,7,B) and (0,2,6,9) respectively. For this
task, we can use a The following awk script eliminates repeated tokens within
a record: (huniq: We might call this script **huniq** since it acts like a
horizontal version of the **uniq** command:

``awk '{
>
>> # A script to eliminate repeated tokens within a record.
if ($0 ~ /^[!*]/) {print $0; next}
else
>>
>>> { array[$1] = line = $1
for (i=2; i<=NF; i++)
>>>
>>>> {
if (array[$i] == "") {array[$i]=$i; line = line " " $i}
}
>>>
>>> print line
for (i in array) delete array[i]
}
>>
>> }' $1``

Applying this script to our output !!!COM: Copland, A. !!!OTL: El Salon
Mexico **pc *Itromp *clefG2 *k[] *M4/4 r 2 7 B 2 B 7 0 9 2 6 0 9 6 2 6 r *-
Identifying implicit harmonic intervals can be a little more taxing. Let's
begin by considering a monophonic passage that exhibits a pseudo-polyphonic
or compound melodic tendency. A passage from Bach's "Gigue" from the solo
'cello *Suite No. 3* is shown in Example 35.1.

**Example 35.1* J.S. Bach, "Gigue" from *Suite No. 3* for solo 'cello
(excerpt).
