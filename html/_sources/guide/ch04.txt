Chapter 4: Basic Pitch Translations
=====================================


Many musical processes entail some sort of data translation in which one form
of representation is transformed into another form of representation. There
are innumerable examples of such musical "translations." For example, we
might rewrite guitar tablatures as notated pitches. Pitches might be
translated to tonic-solfa syllables. Scale-degrees might be analyzed as
Roman-numeral harmonies. Figured bass notations might be "realized" as
pitches. Successive pitches might be characterized as melodic intervals.
Intervals might be rewritten as semitone distances. Pitch-class sets might be
transformed to interval-class vectors.

In this chapter we introduce some basic musical translations. We will limit
this initial discussion to translating between various representations
related to pitch. These will include French, German, and international pitch
designations, frequency, semitones, cents, solfege, scale-degree and MIDI
pitch representations. In later chapters we will describe additional types of
translations.


ISO Pitch Representation
------------------------

The best-known system for representing equally-tempered pitches is the
International Standards Organization (ISO) format consisting of a letter
(A-G) followed by an optional sharp or flat, followed by an octave number.
According to the ISO representation middle C is designated C4. Octave numbers
change between B and C so that the B a semitone below C4 is B3. Humdrum
provides a predefined ISO-like representation called |pitch|_ illustrated below. Here we see an ascending chromatic scale in the left
spine, with a concurrent descending chromatic scale in the right spine:

.. literalinclude:: examples/ex4_1.krn
   :language: kern
   :tab-width: 16



Notice that only upper-case letters are used for pitch-name and that the flat
is represented by the lower-case letter ``b``'. The small letter ``x``' can
be used to indicate double-sharps and the double-flat is represented by two
small successive letters ``bb``'. If a given pitch deviates from equal
temperament, cents deviation can be indicated by trailing integers preceded
by either a plus sign (tuned sharp) or a minus sign (tuned flat). The unit of
the *cent* is one one-hundredth of a semitone, so the distance between C4 and
C#4 is 100 cents. For example, the pitch corresponding to a tuning of A-435
Hz is 19 cents flat compared with the standard A-440, hence it is represented
in |**pitch|_ as:

``A4-19``

Other pitch representations (such as |**kern|_\ ) can be translated to the
ISO-inspired |**pitch|_ representation by invoking the |pitch|_ command.
For example, consider the following |**kern|_ input:

.. code-block:: kern

    **kern
    =1
    4g
    4g#
    4a
    4cc
    =2
    *-

It can be translated to this |**pitch|_ output:


.. code-block:: kern

    **pitch
    =1
    G4
    G#4
    A4
    C5
    =2
    *-

using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

	pitch filename

Notice that the |**pitch|_ representation uses the same system for
representing barlines as |**kern|_\ . In fact, all of the pitch-related
representations described in this chapter make use of the so-called `common
system' for representing barlines.


German Tonhohe
--

The German system of pitch designations (*Tonhohe*) is available in the
Humdrum |**Tonh|_ representation. The German system is similar to the ISO
system with the following exceptions. The pitch letter names include
A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H and S. Sharps and flats are indicated by suffixes: ``is``'
for sharps and ``es``' for flats, hence ``Cis``' for C-sharp and ``Ges``'
for G-flat. Suffixes are repeated for double and triple sharps and flats.
Special exceptions include the following: ``B``' for B-flat, ``H``' for
B-natural, ``Heses``' for B double-flat (rather than ``Bes``'), and
``As``' and ``Es``' rather than ``Aes``' or ``Ees``'. ``S``' is a short-
hand for ``Es``' (E-flat). As in the ISO pitch system, octaves are indicated
by integer numbers with middle C represented as C4.

Although modern German practice has gravitated toward the ISO system, the
traditional German system for representing pitches remains important in
historically related studies, such as searching for `B-A-C-H' and the pitch
signature used by Dmitri Shostakovich (`D-S-C-H').

Data in the |**pitch|_ or |**kern|_\ representations can be translated
to |**Tonh|_ via the |tonh|_ command:

.. code-block:: bash

	tonh filename


French Solfege
--

The common French system for pitch naming uses a so-called "fixed-do" method
of diatonic pitch designations: *do, re, mi, fa, sol, la* and *si* (rather
than *ti*), where *do* corresponds to the English/German `C'. In the Humdrum
|**solfg|_ representation, solfege pitch names are used. Flats (*bemol*)
and sharps (*diese*) are abbreviated *b* and *d* respectively. When
accidentals are encoded, the tilde character (``~``) is encoded following the
solfege syllable and before the accidental. Double and triple sharps and
flats are encoded via repetition. Hence, `do diese' (``do~d``) for C-sharp,
`la bemol' (``la~b``) for A-flat, `sol double-diese' (``sol~dd``) for G
double-sharp, `si double-bemol' (``si~bb``) for B double-flat, and so on. As
with the German and ISO pitch representations, octave is designated by
integers with ``do4`` representing middle C.


Frequency
---------

For acoustic-related applications it may be helpful to translate to
frequency. The Humdrum |**freq|_ representation can be used to represent
frequencies for either pure or complex tones. Frequencies are encoded in
*hertz* (abbreviated *Hz*) where 440 Hz means 440 cycles per second. In the
|**freq|_ representation frequencies may be specified as integer or real
values (with a decimal point).


Cents
-----

The |**cents|_ representation provides a means for representing pitches
in absolute units with respect to middle C (= 0 cents). In the |**cents|_
representation, all pitches are represented with respect to this reference.
Thus C#4 is represented by the number 100, A4 is represented by 900, and A3
is represented by -300. As in the case of |**freq|_\ , cents may be specified
as integer numbers or as real values (with a decimal point).


Semitones
---------

A related pitch representation is |**semits|_\ . In this case, all pitches
are represented in numerical semitones with respect to middle C (= 0 semits).
An ascending chromatic scale beginning on C4 would be represented by the
ascending integers from 0 to 12. Pitches below middle C are represented by
negative values. Fractional values can be represented using decimal points.


MIDI
----

Another way of representing pitch is provided by the Humdrum |**MIDI|_
representation. This representation closely mimics the commercial MIDI
specification. The |**MIDI|_ representation allows MIDI inputs and outputs
to be exported or imported by various Humdrum tools. A complete description
of |**MIDI|_ will be given in |Chapter 7|_\ .


Scale Degree -- \*\*solfa and \*\*deg
-----

Two different Humdrum representations are provided to describe scale-degree
related information: |**deg|_ and |**solfa|_\ . Both of these
representations emphasize slightly different aspects of scale-degree
information. Both representations assume some established or pre-defined
tonal center or tonic pitch.

The |**solfa|_ representation represents pitch according to tonic solfa
syllables. Pitches are designated by the syllables *do, re, mi, fa, so, la*
and *ti* or their chromatic alterations as indicated in the following table:


.. code-block:: kern

    basic       raised          lowered
    do (*doe*)  di (*dee*)      de (*day*)
    re (*ray*)  ri (*ree*)      ra (*raw*)
    mi (*me*)   my (*my*)       me (*may*)
    fa (*fah*)  fi (*fee*)      fe (*fay*)
    so (*so*)   si (*see*)      se (*say*)
    la (*la*)   li (*lee*)      le (*lay*)
    ti (*tee*)  ty (*tie*)      te (*tay*)

*Summary of |solfa|_ Signifiers*

The |**deg|_ representation identifies scale-degrees by the numbers 1
(tonic) to 7 (leading-tone). These values may be chromatically altered by
raising (+) or lowering (-). The *amount* of chromatic alteration is not
indicated; for example, both a raised supertonic and a doubly-raised
supertonic are represented as ``2+``. A lowered dominant is represented as
``5-``.

The |**solfa|_ representation differs from |**deg|_ in that pitches
are represented without regard to major or minor *mode.* For example, in the
key of C major, |**deg|_ will characterize A-flat as a lowered sixth scale
degree (``6-``), whereas the same pitch will be a normal (unaltered) sixth
scale degree in the key of C minor (``6``). In the case of |**solfa|_\ , the
A-flat will be represented as ``le`` -- whether or not the key is C major or
C minor. Like |**deg|_\ , the amount of chromatic alteration is not
represented in |**solfa|_\ . Once a pitch is raised, raising it further will
not change the representation. For example, if the tonic is B-flat, then both
B-natural and B-sharp will be represented by ``di`` in the |**solfa|_
representation.

In the case of the minor mode, |**deg|_ characterizes scale degrees with
respect to the *harmonic minor* scale only.

Another difference between |**solfa|_ and |**deg|_ is that the
|**deg|_ representation provides a way for encoding *melodic approach.* The
caret (``^``) denotes an ascending melodic approach to the current note,
whereas the lower-case letter ``v`` denotes a descending melodic approach.
Repeated pitches carry no melodic approach signifier.

Some of the differences between the |**solfa|_ and |**deg|_ representations
are illustrated in Example 4.1. (The corresponding |**kern|_\ _
representation is given in the first spine.) Notice that |**solfa|_ does not
encode any octave information. The |**deg|_ representation does not encode
the octave of the starting pitch, but it does indicate contour information
using the caret (``^``) for ascending and the lower-case ``v`` for descending
pitches. Notice also the different ways of characterizing accidentals.

Pitch Translations
------------------

Humdrum provides a number of commands for translating between the various
pitch-related representations described above. Typically, the command name is
the same as the name of the output representation. For example, translating
to the |**solfg|_ representation can be accomplished with:

.. code-block:: bash

	solfg inputfile > outputfile

Translating to the German |**Tonh|_ representation:

.. code-block:: bash

	tonh inputfile > outputfile

Translating to ISO |**pitch|_\ :

.. code-block:: bash

	pitch inputfile > outputfile

Similarly, the |freq|_ command translates pitch-related inputs to the
|**freq|_ representation, the |cents|_ command translates appropriate
inputs to the |**cents|_ representation, and so on.

In a few cases, the command names are slightly modified. All Humdrum command
names employ lower-case letters only, so |**MIDI|_ output is generated by
the |midi|_ command (rather than the |MIDI|_ command), and |**Tonh|_
output is generated by the |tonh|_ command.

Examples 4.2 and 4.3 compare several parallel representations of the same
pitch-related information. In both examples, the pitch information has been
derived from the |**kern|_ data shown in the left-most spine. The duration
information in the |**kern|_ data is not available in the other
representations. However, the `common system' for barlines is used
throughout.

Example 4.2 shows four pitch naming systems: ISO pitch, German Tonhohe,
French solfege, as well as |**kern|_\ . Notice the different ways of treating
accidentals such as the D-sharp and B-flat. Also note the German use of H for
B-natural.

**Example 4.2**

.. code-block:: humdrum

	==			==			==		==
	*-			*-			*-		*-

In Example 4.3 four of the more technical representations are illustrated,
including frequency and cents. Notice that the |**MIDI|_ representation
uses key-numbers to represent pitch: key-on events are indicated by positive
integers (between two slashes) and key-off events are indicated by negative
integers. More detail concerning |**MIDI|_ is given in |Chapter 7|_\ .

Not all of the above pitch-related representations can be translated directly
from one to another. Table 4.1 shows the possible translations supported by
Humdrum Release 2.0 commands. The input representations are listed from right
to left. Under each column, those commands that will translate *from* the
given format are identified. For example, the |**cents|_ representation
can be translated to |**freq|_\ , |**kern|_\ , |**pitch|_\ , |**semits|_\ ,
|**solfg|_\ , and |**tonh|_\ . Notice that |**deg|_ data cannot be translated
to any other format since |**deg|_ representations do not encode absolute
pitch height. Note also that when translating to the |**kern|_
representation, only pitch-related information is translated: duration,
articulation marks, and other |**kern|_ signifiers are not magically
generated.

Transposition Using the *trans* Command
--------

A common pitch-related manipulation is transposition. The |trans|_
command has the user specify a *diatonic offset* and a *chromatic offset*.
The diatonic offset affects the pitch-letter name used to spell a note. The
chromatic offset affects the number of semitones shifted from the original
pitch height. The two types of offset are completely independent of each
other. For common transpositions, both the diatonic and chromatic offsets
will need to be specified. For example, in transposing up a minor third (e.g.
C to E-flat), the diatonic offset is `up two pitch-letter names,' and the
chromatic offset is `up three semitones.' The appropriate command invocation
is:

.. code-block:: bash

	trans -d +2 -c +3 input > output

The diatonic offset can be a little confusing because traditional terminology
labels perfect unisons by the number 1 (e.g. P1) rather than zero. So
transposing up a perfect fifth involves a diatonic offset of +4 letter names,
and a chromatic offset of +7 semitones:

.. code-block:: bash

	trans -d +4 -c +7 input > output

We can transpose without changing the diatonic pitch names. For example, the
following command will transpose down an augmented unison (e.g. C# to C):

.. code-block:: bash

	trans -d 0 -c -1 input > output

Conversely, we can respell the diatonic pitches without changing the overall
pitch height. For example, the following transposition will transpose "up" a
diminished second (e.g. from F-sharp to G-flat):

.. code-block:: bash

	trans -d +1 -c 0 input > output

Modal transpositions are also possible by omitting the chromatic offset
option. Consider, for example, the following C major scale:

.. code-block:: humdrum

	**kern
	d
	e
	f
	g
	a
	b
	cc
	*-

We can transform this using the following diatonic transposition:

.. code-block:: bash

	trans -d +1

The resulting output is the Dorian mode:

.. code-block:: humdrum

	**kern
	*Trd1
	d
	e
	f
	g
	a
	b
	cc
	dd
	*-

When using the ``-d`` option alone, |trans|_ eliminates all accidentals in
the input. This can be potentially confusing, but it is often useful. Suppose
you have a passage in the key of E major which you would like to translate to
E Dorian. First transpose so the tonic is D using only the ``-d`` option;
then transpose exactly so the tonic is E again:

.. code-block:: bash

	trans -d -1 Emajor | trans -d +1 -c +2 > Edorian

For some changes of mode (such as melodic to harmonic minor), you may need to
use the |humsed|_ command described in |Chapter 14|_ to modify
accidentals for specific scale degrees.

Notice the addition of a "tandem interpretation" to the above example
(``*Trd1``). Whenever |trans|_ is invoked, it adds a record indicating that
the encoding is no longer at the original pitch. *Transposition tandem
interpretations* are similar in syntax to the |trans|_ command itself. In
the above example, ``*Trd1`` indicates a diatonic shift up one letter name.
The tandem interpretation ``*Trd-1c-2`` would indicate that a score has been
transposed down a major second. The |trans|_ command also provides a ``-k``
option that allows the user to specify a replacement key signature for the
output.

The |trans|_ command can be used in conjunction with any of the appropriate
pitch-related representations, such as |**pitch|_\ , |**kern|_\ , |**Tonh|_\ ,
and |**solfg|_\ .


Key Interpretations
-------------------

In order for the |solfa|_ or |deg|_ commands to translate from other pitch
representations, the encoded music must contain an explicit key indication.
Keys are explicitly represented by a single asterisk, followed by an upper-
or lower-case letter, followed by an optional accidental, followed by a
colon. The octothorpe (``#``) indicates a sharp and the hyphen (``-``)
indicates a flat.

Upper-case letters indicate major keys; lower-case letters indicate minor
keys. By way of illustration, the following key interpretations indicate the
keys of C major, C minor, B-flat major, and F-sharp minor:

> ``*C:
> *c:
> *B-:
> *f#:

Key interpretations usually appear near the beginning of a representation,
and key interpretations can be redefined at any place in a score.


Pitch Processing
----------------

Apart from transposition, translating from one representation to another
provides opportunities for different sorts of processing. Suppose, for
example, we wanted to know whether the subdominant pitch occurs more
frequently in one vocal repertory than in another repertory. We can use |solfa|_ in conjunction with `grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_'s ``-c`` option to count the number of
occurrences. (For the following examples, we will assume that the inputs
consist of only a single spine, that barlines are absent, and that
appropriate interpretations are provided indicating the key of each work.)
First we need to count the total number of notes in each repertory.

.. code-block:: bash

	census -k repertory1.krn

.. code-block:: bash

	census -k repertory2.krn

Next we translate the scores to the |solfa|_ representation and use **grep
-c** to count the number of occurrences of the number `fa':

.. code-block:: bash

	solfa repertory1.krn | grep -c fa

.. code-block:: bash

	solfa repertory2.krn | grep -c fa

The proportion of subdominant pitches can be calculated by simply comparing
the resulting pattern count with the number of notes identified by
|census|_\ .

Recall that one of the differences between the |**solfa|_ and
|**deg|_ representations is that the |**deg|_ output contains an
indication of the direction of melodic approach. The caret (**^**) indicates
approach from below, whereas the lower-case**v**indicates approach from
above. Suppose we wanted to determine whether the dominant pitch is more
commonly approached from above or from below. Assuming a monophonic input, we
can once again use `grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_ to answer this question. First let's count how
many dominant pitches (`5') are approached from above (`v'):

.. code-block:: bash

	deg repertory.krn | grep -c v5

The caret has a special meaning for `grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_ which will be discussed in
|Chapter 9|_\ . We can escape the special meaning by preceding the caret by a
backslash. In order to count the number of dominant pitches approached from
below we can use the following:

.. code-block:: bash

	deg repertory.krn | grep -c \^5

Recall that some scale tones are spelled differently depending on whether the
mode is major or minor. For example, in A major the mediant pitch is C sharp;
but in A minor the mediant pitch is C natural. The |deg|_ and |solfa|_ commands produce subtly contrasting outputs that make one or the other
command better suited depending on the user's goal. The |deg|_ command would
represent C sharp in A major, and C natural in A minor by the same scale
degree -- ``3``. In the key of A major, C natural would be characterized as a
lowered mediant (``3-``) and in A minor, C sharp would be characterized as a
raised mediant (``3+``). By contrast, the |solfa|_ command characterizes
pitches with respect to the tonic alone and ignores the mode. Hence, |solfa|_ would designate C sharp as ``mi``' whether the key was A major or
A minor. Similarly, C natural would be designated ``me``' in both A major
and A minor. The differences between |deg|_ and |solfa|_ allow users to
distinguish chromatically altered scale tones in a manner appropriate to the
task.


Uses for Pitch Translations
---------------------------

Occasionally it is useful to process a given representation to the *same*
representation. The |kern|_ command translates various pitch-related
representations to the |**kern|_ format. The ``-x`` option eliminates any
input data that do not pertain to pitch. When applied to a |**kern|_ input,
this option allows us to filter out durations, articulation marks, phrasing,
and other non-pitch data. Suppose, for example, that we wanted to determine
the proportion of successively repeated notes in a vocal melody: how often is
a pitch followed immediately by the same pitch? We might begin by first
determining the total number of notes in the melody using |census|_ with the
``-k`` option.

.. code-block:: bash

	census -k melody.krn

We can use the `uniq <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniq>`_ command to eliminate successive repeated pitches --
but only if the note tokens are identical. First we can use `**kern -x**`_ to
translate "from |**kern|_ to |**kern|_\ " while eliminating non-pitch-related
data. Then we need to remove barlines so they don't interfere with pitches
that are repeated across the measure. Using `uniq <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniq>`_ will then eliminate all
of the successively duplicated records, so a sequence of six G's will be
reduced to a single G. Finally, we pipe the output to **census -k** to count
the total number of notes.

.. code-block:: bash

	kern -x melody.krn | uniq | census -k

A variation on this approach would entail translating to a representation
that does not distinguish enharmonic pitches. For example, translating our
melody to |**semits|_ and then back to |**kern|_\ will standarize all
of the enharmonic spellings. If our melody contains a G-sharp that undergoes
an enharmonic shift to A-flat, then the pitches will be deemed identical. The
following command carries out the same task as above, but ignores possible
enharmonic spellings:

.. code-block:: bash

	semits melody.krn | kern | uniq | census -k

Incidentally, given |**semits|_ input, the |kern|_ command will spell
pitches according to any key or key signatures it encounters. For example, if
the key signature contains sharps, then G-sharp will be output; if the key or
key signature contains flats, then A-flat will be output.

Reprise
-------

In this chapter we have introduced a number of pre-defined pitch-related
representations. Simple commands can be used to translate from one
representation to another. Which representation is most appropriate depends
on the user's goal.

There is a wealth of other representation formats related to pitch distances,
tablatures, timing, and other types of musical information. These
representations will be explored in later chapters. In addition, we'll
describe how to design your own representations -- representations that may
be better tailored to a specific application. However, before we continue
discussing further representations, this is an appropriate point to present a
more formal description of the general Humdrum representation syntax.
