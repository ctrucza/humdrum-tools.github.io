Chapter 13: Assembling Scores
================================

In the previous chapter we learned how to extract parts and passages from
Humdrum files. In this chapter we discuss the reverse procedures: how to
assemble and coordinate larger documents from individual segments and parts.
We will discuss four tools: the UNIX `cat <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_(Unix)>`_ command, and the Humdrum
`assemble <../../man/assemble>`_, `timebase <../../man/timebase>`_ and `rid <../../man/rid>`_ commands.


The *cat* Command
--------

The UNIX `cat <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_(Unix)>`_ command allows two or more inputs to be concatenated
together. If we concatenate two files, the output will consist of the
contents of the first file, followed immediately by the contents of the
second file. For example, the following command will concatenate together the
files ``mov.1``, ``mov.2`` and ``mov.3`` and place the result in the file
`` complete``. The order of concatenation is the same as the order of file
names given on the command line:

`` cat mov.1 mov.2 mov.3 > complete``

If each of the concatenated files conforms to the Humdrum syntax, then the
resulting combined file is guaranteed to conform to the Humdrum syntax.
However, in many cases, there may be redundant information present in the
concatenated output. Suppose we had three files, each of which encoded a
single measure of music. Concatenating them together might result in an
output such as the following:

`` !! File 1
`` **kern**kern**kern**kern
`` *M4/4*M4/4*M4/4*M4/4
`` *G:*G:*G:*G:
`` *k[f#]*k[f#]*k[f#]*k[f#]
`` 4GG4B4d4g
`` =1=1=1=1
`` 4GG4d4g4b
`` 4FF#4d[4a4dd
`` 8GG4d8a]4b
`` 8BB.[8g.
`` 4D4d8g]4a
`` ..8f#.
`` *-*-*-*-
`` !! File 2
`` **kern**kern**kern**kern
`` *M4/4*M4/4*M4/4*M4/4
`` *k[f#]*k[f#]*k[f#]*k[f#]
`` =2=2=2=2
`` 8G4d4g4b
`` 8F#...
`` 4E4e4g4cc#
`` 4D;4A;4f#;4dd;
`` 8A4cn4a4ee
`` 8G...
`` *-*-*-*-
`` !! File 3
`` **kern**kern**kern**kern
`` *M4/4*M4/4*M4/4*M4/4
`` *k[f#]*k[f#]*k[f#]*k[f#]
`` *k[f#]*k[f#]*k[f#]*k[f#]
`` =3=3=3=3
`` 4F#4d[4a8dd
`` ...8cc
`` 4G4d8a]4b
`` ..[8g.
`` 8C#8e8g]4a
`` 8D#4B8f#.
`` 8E.8e8g
`` 8F#8A8d8a
`` *-*-*-*-``

Notice that each complete measure ends with spine-path terminators and that
the `**kern <../../rep/kern>`_ exclusive interpretations are repeated. This organization
has a number of repercussions for various Humdrum tools. For example, the
`mint <../../man/mint>`_ command calculates melodic intervals between successive notes
within a spine. However, **mint** will not calculate intervals between
pitches that are separated by a spine-path terminator. In other words, in the
above output, **mint** will fail to calculate the melodic intervals between
notes in successive measures.


The *rid* Command
--------

This problem can be resolved by using the Humdrum `rid <../../man/rid>`_ command. The
**rid** command can be used to eliminate various kinds of records. Each
option for **rid** eliminates a different class of records. Here are the
record classes with their associated options:

> -Geliminate all global comments
> -geliminate only global comments that are empty
> -Leliminate all local comments
> -leliminate only local comments that are empty
> -Ieliminate all interpretations
> -ieliminate only null interpretations
> -Deliminate all data records
> -deliminate only null data records
> -Teliminate all tandem interpretations
> -teliminate duplicate (repeated) tandem interpretations
> -Ueliminate unnecessary exclusive interpretations (see below)
> -usame as -U

Null records are devoid of content. For example, null interpretations consist
of a single asterisk in each spine; null data record consists of just null
data tokens (.) in each spine; null local comments consist of a single
exclamation mark in each spine. Null global comments contain just two
exclamation marks at the beginning of a record.

Upper- and lower-case options are used to distinguish *all* records of a
certain class (upper-case) from *empty*, *null* or *repeated* records of a
certain class (lower-case).

By way of example, the following command will eliminate all global comments
(including reference records) from the input:

`` rid -G Saint-Saens``

Similarly, the following command will eliminate all tandem interpretations
from an input:

`` rid -T Vaughan-Williams``

Options can be combined. The following command eliminates all global and
local comments, interpretations, and null data records:

`` rid -GLId``

The option combination **-GLId** is very common with **rid** since only non-
null data records are retained in the output.

With the **-u** option, **rid** will remove "unnecessary" exclusive
interpretations. Exclusive interpretations are deemed unnecessary if they
don't change the current status of the data. In the following example, the
second ``psaltery`` interpretation is redundant. The **rid -u** command
would remove the first spine-path terminator and the second exclusive
interpretation -- leaving a continuous data spine.

`` **psaltery
`` .``
`` .``
`` .``
`` *-``
`` **psaltery
`` .``
`` *-``

In addition, **rid** provides a **-t** option which removes "duplicate" or
repeated tandem interpretations. In the above example there is no need to
repeat the meter signature and key signature in each measure.  The following
command will concatenate each of the three measures together, and then
eliminate the unwanted interpretations:

`` cat bar1 bar2 bar3 | rid -ut``

The resulting output is given below:

`` !! File 1
`` **kern**kern**kern**kern
`` *M4/4*M4/4*M4/4*M4/4
`` *k[f#]*k[f#]*k[f#]*k[f#]
`` 4GG4B4d4g
`` =1=1=1=1
`` 4GG4d4g4b
`` 4FF#4d[4a4dd
`` 8GG4d8a]4b
`` 8BB.[8g.
`` 4D4d8g]4a
`` ..8f#.
`` !! File 2
`` =2=2=2=2
`` 8G4d4g4b
`` 8F#...
`` 4E4e4g4cc#
`` 4D;4A;4f#;4dd;
`` 8A4cn4a4ee
`` 8G...
`` !! File 3
`` =3=3=3=3
`` 4F#4d[4a8dd
`` ...8cc
`` 4G4d8a]4b
`` ..[8g.
`` 8C#8e8g]4a
`` 8D#4B8f#.
`` 8E.8e8g
`` 8F#8A8d8a
`` *-*-*-*-``

Of course care should be exercised when concatenating inputs together.
Although an output may conform to the Humdrum syntax, the result can
nevertheless violate conventions for a specific representation such as
`` **kern``. For example, if we were to concatenate measure 85 to measure 87,
it is possible that tied-notes won't match up, or that phrases will begin
without ending, etc. These anomalies may cause problems with subsequent
processing.


Assembling Parts Using the *assemble* Command
--------

Assembling parts into a full score is slightly more challenging than
concatenating together musical segments. The principle tool for joining
spines together is the `assemble <../../man/assemble>`_ command. Consider the following two
files:

`` !! Assemble example
`` !! File 1
`` **Letters
`` ! A to E
`` A
`` B
`` C
`` D
`` E
`` *-``

`` !! Assemble example
`` !! File 2
`` **Numbers
`` ! 1 to 5
`` 1
`` 2
`` 3
`` 4
`` 5
`` *-``

These two files can be aligned side by side using **assemble**:

`` assemble letters numbers``

The resulting output is:

`` !! Assemble example
`` !! File 1
`` !! File 2
`` **Letters**Numbers
`` ! A to E! 1 to 5
`` A1
`` B2
`` C3
`` D4
`` E5
`` *-*-``

Note the following: (1) The spines are joined side by side from left to right
in the same order as specified on the command line. (2) Local comments are
preserved in their appropriate spines. (3) When identical global comments
occur at the same location in both files, only a single instance of the
comment is output. (4) Dissimilar global comments are output successively.

The files joined by **assemble** are not confined to a single spine. For
example, one input file may contain 2 spines and a second file may contain 20
spines. The resulting output will contain 22 spines. There is no limit to the
number of files that can be assembled at one time.

In many cases, the input files will have dissimilar lengths. The **assemble**
command will correctly terminate the appropriate spines. For example, in the
above case, if the ``numbers`` file contained only the numbers 1 to 3, the
assembled output would appear as follows:

`` !! Assemble example
`` !! File 1
`` !! File 2
`` **Letters**Numbers
`` ! A to E! 1 to 3
`` A1
`` B2
`` C3
`` **-
`` D
`` E
`` *-``

If the order of the input files was reversed, **assemble** would produce an
output with the appropriate spine-path changes:

`` !! Assemble example
`` !! File 2
`` !! File 1
`` **Numbers**Letters
`` ! 1 to 3! A to E
`` 1A
`` 2B
`` 3C
`` *-*
`` D
`` E
`` *-``

Note that if all of the input files conform to the Humdrum syntax, then
`assemble <../../man/assemble>`_ guarantees that the assembled output will also conform to the
Humdrum syntax.


Aligning Durations Using the *timebase* Command
--------

Suppose now that we wanted to join two hypothetical files containing
`` `**kern```_ data. The first file contains two quarter notes, whereas the
second file contains four eighth notes:

`` !! File 1
`` **kern
`` 4c
`` 4d
`` *-``

`` !! File 2
`` **kern
`` 8e
`` 8g
`` 8f
`` 8g
`` *-``

Using **assemble** to paste them together will clearly lead to an
uncoordinated result. The two quarter notes in file 1 will be incorrectly
matched with the first two eighth notes in file 2.

The Humdrum `timebase <../../man/timebase>`_ command can be used to reformat either
`` `**kern```_ or `**recip <../../rep/recip>`_ inputs so that each output data record
represents an equivalent slice (elapsed duration) of time. (Barlines are
ignored by **timebase**.) The **timebase** command achieves this by padding
an input with null data records. In the above case, we would preprocess file
1 as follows:

`` timebase -t 8 file1 > file1.tb``

The new file would look like this:

`` !! File 1
`` **kern
`` 4c
`` .
`` 4d
`` .
`` *-``

The **-t** option is used to indicate the "time base" -- in this case, an
eighth duration. Since all non-barline data records in both files represent
elapsed durations of an eighth-note, we can continue by using the
**assemble** command as before. The command:

`` assemble file1.tb file2``

will result in the following two-part score:

`` !! File 1
`` !! File 2
`` **kern**kern
`` 4c8e
`` .8g
`` 4d8f
`` .8g
`` *-*-``

Suppose that ``file2`` also contained a quarter-note. For example, consider a
revised ``file2``:

`` !! File 2
`` **kern
`` 8e
`` 8g
`` 4f
`` *-``

Before assembling the two parts, we would need to apply the **timebase**
command to this file (using the same 8th-note time-base value). Assembling
the two "time-based" files would produce the following result:

`` !! File 1
`` !! File 2
`` **kern**kern
`` 4c8e
`` .8g
`` 4d4f
`` ..
`` *-*-``

Notice that we have a spurious null data record in the last line; both parts
encode null tokens. For most processing, the presence of null data records is
inconsequential. However, if we wish, these null data records can be
eliminated using the **rid** command with the **-d** option. In fact it is
common to follow an **assemble** command with **rid -d** to strip away
unnecessary null data records. The command:

`` assemble file1.tb file2.tb | rid -d``

would result in the following output:

`` !! File 1
`` !! File 2
`` **kern**kern
`` 4c8e
`` .8g
`` 4d4f
`` *-*-``

The `timebase <../../man/timebase>`_ command can be applied to multi-spine inputs as well as
single-spine inputs. Consider, the following input:



`` **kern**kern**kern**kern**commentary
`` 4g8.r8.cc16ee2nd inversion
`` ...8ff.
`` .32b16cc16ggclash
`` .32a...
`` 8f8cc8dd8ffsuspension
`` *-*-*-*-*-``

The following command will cause the addition of null data records so that
each data record represents an elapsed time of a 32nd duration. Incidentally,
notice that any spine contain non-rhythmic data -- such as the
`` **commentary`` spine in the above example -- is also transformed so that
synchronous data is maintained.

`` timebase -t 32 Corelli``

The corresponding output is as follows.



`` **kern**kern**kern**kern**commentary
`` *tb32*tb32*tb32*tb32*tb32
`` 4g8.r8.cc16ee2nd inversion
`` .....
`` ...8ff.
`` .....
`` .....
`` .....
`` .32b16cc16ggclash
`` .32a...
`` 8f8cc8dd8ffsuspension
`` .....
`` .....
`` .....
`` *-*-*-*-*-``

Notice that **timebase** has added a tandem interpretation (``*tb32``). This
indicates that the output has been processed so that each non-barline data
record represents an elapsed duration equivalent to a thirty-second note.


Assembling N-tuplets
--------------------

Typically, one can simply use the shortest duration present as a guide for a
suitable time-base value. The shortest duration can be determined using the
`census <../../man/census>`_ -k command described in `Chapter 4 <../ch04>`_. However, tuplets require
a little more sophistication. Suppose we wanted to assemble two parts, one
containing just eighth-notes and the other containing just quarter-note
triplets. (The quarter-note triplets will be encoded as three notes in the
time of a half-note, or "6th" notes.) We need to create an output whose
rhythmic structure will appear as follows:



`` **kern**kern
`` *M2/4*M2/4
`` =1=1
`` 68
`` .8
`` 6.
`` .8
`` 6.
`` .8
`` =2=2
`` 68
`` .8
`` 6.
`` .8
`` 6.
`` .8
`` =3=3
`` *-*-``

In this case, choosing a time-base according to the shortest duration (8th)
will not work since a 6th note is not an integral multiple of the eighth
duration. We need to find a *common duration factor* for both values. The
shortest common duration is a 24th note (there are three 24th notes in an 8th
note, and four 24th notes in a 6th note). Applying the time-base value `24'
to both files will allow us to coordinate them properly. Remember that **rid
-d** can be used to eliminate unnecessary null data records once we have
finished assembling the spines. In the worst case, you can determine a common
duration factor by simply multiplying together the shortest notes in the
files to be assembled. For example, 6 x 8 = 48; so a time-base of 48 will be
guaranteed to work for both files.


Checking an Assembled Score Using *proof*
-----

In assembling any score from a set of parts, there is always the danger of
using the wrong time-base value. When parts are miscoordinated, it is
typically the consequence of one or more notes being discarded by
**timebase**. Fortunately, such miscoordinations are easily detected by
applying the `proof <../../man/proof>`_ command to any assembled \*\*kern output. The
**proof** utility checks \*\*kern representations for a wide variety of
possible encoding errors or ambiguities:

`` proof fullscore``

By way of summary, creating a full score from a set of `**kern <../../rep/kern>`_ parts
involves the following five tasks: (1) Identify a common duration factor for
all the parts. Use `census <../../man/census>`_ to determine the shortest duration; if any
of the parts contains an N-tuplet, then the common duration factor may be
smaller than the shortest note. (2) Use the `timebase <../../man/timebase>`_ command to expand
each input file separately using the common duration factor. (3) Assemble the
parts using `**assemble**.`_ (4) If desired, eliminate unnecessary null data
records usingi `**rid -d**.`_ (5) Check the assembled score for rhythmic
coherence using the `proof <../../man/proof>`_ command.


Other Uses for the *timebase* Command
--------

The most common use of **timebase** is as a way of expanding a file by
padding it with null data records. However, **timebase** can also be used to
contract a file, giving us only those sonorities that lie a fixed duration
apart. For example, specifying a time-base of **-t 2** will cause only those
sonorities that are separated by a half-note duration to be output. This sort
of rhythmic reduction can be useful in certain circumstances. For example,
suppose you suspect there may be a hemiola tendency in a given work by
Brahms, where the duration separating hemiola notes is a dotted-quarter. The
command:

`` timebase -t 4. brahms``

can be used to extract only those sonorities that are separated by a dotted-
quarter duration.

Similarly, suppose we want to extract all sonorities falling on the third
beat of a waltz written in 3/2 meter. First we would edit the input file so
it begins on the third beat of some measure. Then we could use the following
command:

`` grep -v ^= waltz | timebase -t 1. > 3rd_beat``

Note that the use of `grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_ here is essential in order to eliminate
barlines. The **timebase** command resets itself with each barline, so time-
base durations are calculated from the beginning of the bar. When barlines
are eliminated, **timebase** cannot synchronize to the beginning of each bar
and so simply floats along at the fixed time-base.


Additional Uses of *assemble* and *timebase*
--------

Although we normally assemble parts together, sometimes it is useful to
assemble entire scores together. Suppose we wanted to listen to a theme at
the same time as one of its variations. We might first use `yank <../../man/yank>`_ to
extract the appropriate sections. At the same time we might determine a
common duration factor and expand them using **timebase**.

`` yank -s Theme -r 1 blacksmith | timebase -t 32 > temp1``
`` yank -s 'Variation 1' -r 1 blacksmith | timebase -t 32 > temp2``

Then we assemble the two sections together, translate to the `**MIDI <../../rep/MIDI>`_
representation and use `perform <../../man/perform>`_ to listen to both sections at the same
time:

`` assemble temp1 temp2 | midi | perform``

Similarly, suppose we would like to compare the bass lines for each variation
in some set. We might extract each of the bass lines, assemble them into a
single score, and then use the **ms** and **ghostview** commands to allow us
to see all of the bass lines for all of the variations concurrently.

`` yank -s 'Variation 1' -r 1 goldberg | timebase -t 16 > temp1``
`` yank -s 'Variation 2' -r 1 goldberg | timebase -t 16 > temp2``
etc. ...
`` assemble temp1 temp2 temp3 ... | rid -d | ms > basslines.ps``
`` ghostview basslines.ps``

The most common use of **assemble** is not to assemble parts, but to assemble
different types of concurrent information. Suppose we would like to determine
whether descending minor seconds are more likely to be *fa-mi* rather than
*do-ti*. We can use the `mint <../../man/mint>`_ command to characterize melodic
intervals, and the `solfa <../../man/solfa>`_ command to characterize scale degrees. Assume
that our input is monophonic:

`` mint melodies > temp1``
`` solfa melodies > temp2``

The files ``temp1`` and ``temp2`` will have the same length, so we can
assemble them together. This will generate an output consisting of two
spines, `**mint <../../rep/mint>`_ and `**solfa <../../rep/solfa>`_. In effect, the `**mint <../../rep/mint>`_ spine
data will tell us the interval used to approach the scale degree encoded in
the `**solfa <../../rep/solfa>`_ spine. We can use `grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_ to search for the appropriate
combinations of interval and scale degree and count the number of
occurrences:

`` assemble temp1 temp2 | grep -c '-m2.*mi'``
`` assemble temp1 temp2 | grep -c '-m2.*ti'``

This same approach can be used to address (innumerable) questions pertaining
to concurrent patterns. For example, suppose we have a `**harm <../../rep/harm>`_ spine
that identifies the `Roman numeral' functional harmony for some choral work.
We can identify complex situations such as the following: for the soprano
voice, count how many subdominant pitches are approached by an interval of a
rising third or a rising sixth and coincide with a dominant seventh chord.
First, let's extract the soprano line and create a corresponding scale degree
representation using **deg**. We can use the **-a** option to avoid
outputting the melodic direction signifiers (``^`` and ``v``):

`` extract -i '*Isopran' howells | deg -a > temp1``

Next, let's again extract the soprano voice and create a corresponding
melodic interval representation using **mint**. Since we are not interested
in interval qualities we can invoke the **-d** option to output only diatonic
interval sizes.

`` extract -i '*Isopran' howells | mint -d > temp2``
`` extract -i '**harm' howells > temp3``

We have also extracted the `**harm <../../rep/harm>`_ spine and placed it in the file
`` temp3``. If we assemble together our three temporary files, the result will
have three spines: `**deg <../../rep/deg>`_, `**mint <../../rep/mint>`_ and `**harm <../../rep/harm>`_. We can now use
`grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_ to search and count all instances of subdominant pitches that are
approached by ascending thirds/sixths and that coincide with dominant seventh
chords (in the \*\*kern representation: ```V7``'):

`` assemble temp1 temp2 temp3 | grep -c '^4``**``+[36]``**``V7``

The **timebase** command can also be used for tasks other than assembling
parts together. Suppose we would like to determine whether secondary dominant
chords are more likely to appear on the third beat than other beats in a
triple meter work. The **timebase** command can be used to reformat a score
so that each measure occupies the same number of data records. For example,
in a 3/4 meter, an eighth-note time-base will mean that each measure will
contain six data records, and the fifth data record will correspond to the
onset of the third beat. Recall from `Chapter 12 <../ch12>`_ that the **yank -m**
command allows us to extract particular data records following a specified
marker. In the following command, we have defined the marker as a barline
(``-m ^=``) and instructed **yank** to fetch the fifth line following each
occurrence of the marker (``-r 5``). In our example, the `grep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_ command is
being used to count V/V chords occurring on third beats:

`` timebase -t 8 strauss | solfa | yank -m = -r 5 | grep re \
>
>> | grep fe | grep -c la``

We can repeat this command for beats one and two by changing the **-r**
parameter to 1 and 3 respectively.

In this chapter we have learned how to concatenate musical passages together
using the `cat <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_(Unix)>`_ command. We also learned how to eliminate redundant
exclusive and tandem interpretations from concatenated outputs using the
**-u** and **-t** options for `rid <../../man/rid>`_. In addition, we learned how to
assemble two or more spines into a single output file using `assemble <../../man/assemble>`_.
In the case of `**kern <../../rep/kern>`_ and `**recip <../../rep/recip>`_ representations, we learned
how to use the `timebase <../../man/timebase>`_ command to preprocess each constituent file so
that all data records represent equivalent elapsed durations. Having
assembled a full score from parts, **rid** **-d** can be used to eliminate
any residual or unnecessary null data records. The `proof <../../man/proof>`_ command can
be used to ensure that any assembled \*\*kern data is correctly aligned.

Finally, we learned that the **timebase** command can be used for other
analytic purposes. Specifically, it can be used to reduce a score
rhythmically so only particular onset points or beats are retained. In
`Chapter 23 <../ch23>`_ we will see additional uses of **timebase** for a variety of
types of rhythmic tasks.
