COMMAND
~~~~~~~

**veritas** -- validate that a Humdrum document has not been modified

--------------

SYNOPSIS
~~~~~~~~

`` veritas  [-v]  inputfile``

--------------

DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~

The **veritas** command provides an on-line means for formally or
informally verifying that a given Humdrum file originates with a given
publisher or source, or whether the file has been modified in some way.
The command provides a convenient way of reassuring scholars of the
accuracy or origin of a document.

The **veritas** command looks for a checksum validation number encoded
in a VTS reference record in the given input file. (See the `**Reference
Records (1)** <../guide.append1.html>`__ description.) The command then
calculates the checksum for the file (excluding the VTS record itself)
and compares this value with the checksum encoded in the file. If these
values differ, a warning is issued that the file has been modified in
some way. If these values are the same, a confirming message is issued.

Note that this verification process is easily circumvented by malicious
individuals. For better security, the **-v** option should be invoked
and the output checksum value should be compared with an independent
printed list of checksums provided by the supplier of the electronic
document.

--------------

OPTIONS
~~~~~~~

The **veritas** command provides the following options:

    +----------+---------------------------------------------------------+
    | **-h**   | displays a help screen summarizing the command syntax   |
    +----------+---------------------------------------------------------+
    | **-v**   | invoke verbose mode                                     |
    +----------+---------------------------------------------------------+

Options are specified in the command line.

The **-v** option will cause the checksum validation number to be
output. This value should be manually compared with a printed checksum
provided by the supplier of the electronic document. Note that the
change of even a single character in a file typically leads to a
radically different checksum.

--------------

PORTABILITY
~~~~~~~~~~~

DOS 2.0 and up, with the MKS Toolkit. OS/2 with the MKS Toolkit. UNIX
systems supporting the *Korn* shell or *Bourne* shell command
interpreters, and POSIX.2 compliant **cksum** command.
