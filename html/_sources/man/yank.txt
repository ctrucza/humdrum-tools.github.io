DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~

The **yank** command permits the selective extraction of segments or
passages from a Humdrum input. Yanked material may consist of specified
input records -- addressed by absolute line number, or relative to some
marker. In addition, **yank** is able to output logical segments (such
as measures, phrases, or labelled sections), and is able to output
material according to content. The output always consists of complete
records; **yank** never outputs partial contents of a given input
record.

Options are specified in the command line.

The simplest operation for **yank** occurs when the **-l** option is
specified. In this case **yank** echoes those lines in the input stream
whose line-numbers appear in a specified *range.* The *range* consists
of one of more integers separated by commas; inclusive ranges can be
specified by separating two integers by a dash (-). For example, the
following command selects lines, 5, 13, 23, 24, 25, and 26 from the file
named ``dvorak``:

````

    yank -l -r 5,13,23-26 dvorak

The dollar sign ($) can be used to refer to the last record in the
input. For example, the following command yanks the first and last
records from the file ``verdi``.

````

    yank -l -r '1,$' verdi

(Note that single quotes may be needed in regular expressions and range
specifications in order to prevent the shell from misinterpreting
characters such as the dollar sign or the asterisk.) Records prior to
the end of the input can be specified by subtracting some value from $.
For example, the following command yanks the first 20 records of the
last 30 records contained in the file ``ginastera``. (Notice that the
dash/minus sign is used both to convey a range and as an arithmetic
operator.)

````

    yank -l -r '$-30-$-10' ginastera

In addition to the specified output lines, **yank** also outputs
interpretations and comments as described below (see `INTERPRETATIONS
AND COMMENTS <#INTERPRETATIONS%20AND%20COMMENTS>`__).

Alternatively, **yank** can output lines relative to some user-defined
*marker.* This mode of operation can be invoked using the **-m** option.
Markers are specified as regular expressions. The following command
outputs the first and third data records following each occurrence of
the string "XXX" in the file ``wieck``.

````

    yank -m XXX -r 1,3 wieck

The **-r** option is used to specify the range. If the value zero ("0")
is specified in the range, then the record containing the marker is
itself output.

Since markers are interpreted by **yank** as regular expressions,
complex markers can be defined. For example, the following command yanks
the first data record following all occurrences of any record in the
file ``franck`` beginning with a letter and ending with a number:

````

    yank -m '^[a-zA-Z].\*[0-9]$' -r 1 franck

In musical applications, it is often convenient to yank material
according to logical segments such as measures or phrases. In order to
access such segments, the user must specify a segment *delimiter* using
the **-o** or the **-o** and **-e** options. For example, common system
barlines are represented by the presence of an equals-sign (=) at the
beginning of a data token. Thus the user might yank specific measures
from a `` **kern`` file by defining the appropriate barline delimiter
and providing a range of (measure) numbers. Consider the following
command:

````

    yank -o ^= -r 1,12-13,25 joplin

Unlike the **-m** option, the **-o** option interprets the range list as
ordinal occurrences of segments delineated by the delimiter. Whole
segments are output rather than specified records as is the case with
**-m.** As in the case of markers, delimiters are interpreted according
to regular expression syntax. Each input record containing the delimiter
is regarded as the *start* of the next logical segment. In the above
command, the command-line range specifies that the first, twelfth,
thirteenth, and twenty-fifth logical segments (measures) are to be
yanked from the file named ``joplin``. All records starting with the
delimiter record are output up to, but not including the next occurrence
of a delimiter record.

Where the input stream contains data prior to the first delimiter
record, this data may be addressed as logical segment "zero." For
example,

````

    yank -o '^=' -r 0 mahler

can be used to yank all records prior to the first common system
barline. With the **-o** option, notice that *actual* measure numbers
are irrelevant: **yank** selects segments according to their *ordinal*
position in the input stream rather than according to their *cardinal*
label.

When the **-n** option is invoked, however, **yank** expects a numerical
value to be present in the input immediately following the
user-specified delimiter. In this case, **yank** selects segments based
on their numbered label rather than their ordinal position in the input.
For example,

````

    yank -n ^= -r 12 goldberg

will yank all segments begining with the label ``=12`` in the input file
``goldberg``. If more than one segment carries the specified segment
number(s), all such segment are output. Note that the dollar-sign anchor
cannot be used in the range expression for the **-n** option. Note also
that input tokens containing non-numeric characters appended to the
number will have no effect on the pattern match. For example, input
tokens such as ``=12a, =12b``, or ``=12``; will be treated as equivalent
to ``=12``.

As in the case of the **-o** option, the value zero ("0") addresses
material prior to the first delimiter record. Like the **-o** option,
the value zero may be reused for each specified input file. Thus, if
``file1, file2`` and ``file3`` are Humdrum files:

````

    yank -n ^= -r 0 file1 file2 file3

will yank any leading (anacrusis) material in each of the three files.

When the **-s** option is invoked, **yank** extracts passages according
to Humdrum section labels encoded in the input. Humdrum section labels
are tandem interpretations that conform to the syntax:

`` *>label_name``

Labels are frequently used to indicate formal divisions, such as, coda,
exposition, bridge, second ending, trio, minuet, etc. The following
command yanks the second instance of a section labelled ``First Theme``
in the file ``haydn08``:

````

    yank -s 'First Theme' -r 2 haydn08

Note that with "through-composed" Humdrum files it is possible to have
more than one section containing the same section-label. (See the
`**thru** <thru.html>`__ command.)

--------------

INTERPRETATIONS AND COMMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If **yank** is given a Humdrum input, it always produces a syntactically
correct Humdrum output. All interpretations prior to and within the
yanked material are echoed in the output. The **yank** command also
appends the appropriate spine-path terminators at the end of the yanked
segment.

Any comments *prior* to the yanked passage may be included in the output
by specifying the **-c** option.

--------------

EXAMPLES
~~~~~~~~

The following examples illustrate how the **yank** command may be used.

````

    yank -l -r 1120 messiaen

yanks line 1120 in the file ``messiaen``.

````

    yank -n ^= -r 27 sinfonia

yanks numbered measures 27 from the ``**kern`` file ``sinfonia``.

````

    yank -n ^= -r 10-20 minuet waltz

yanks numbered measures 10 to 20 from *both* the ``**kern`` files
``minuet`` and ``waltz``.

````

    yank -o ^= -r '0,$' fugue ricercar

yanks any initial anacrusis material plus the final measure of both
``fugue`` and ``ricercar``.

`` cat fugue ricercar | yank -o ^= -r '0,$'``

yanks any initial anacrusis material from the file ``fugue`` followed by
the final measure of ``ricercar``.

````

    yank -n 'Rehearsal Marking ' -r 5-7 fugue ricercar

yanks segments beginning with the strings
`` "Rehearsal Marking 5," "Rehearsal Marking 6,"`` and
`` "Rehearsal Marking 7."`` Segments are deemed to end when a record is
encountered containing the string `` "Rehearsal Marking ".``

````

    yank -o { -e } -r '1-$' webern

yanks all segments in the file ``webern`` beginning with a record
containing "{" and ending with a record containing "}." The command:

````

    yank -o { -e } -r '1-4,$-3-$' faure

yanks the first four and last four segments in the file ``faure`` --
where segments begin with an open brace ({) and end with a closed brace
(}). In the ``**kern`` representation, this would extract the first and
last four phrases in the file.

````

    yank -s Coda -r 1 stamitz

will yank the first occurrence of a section labelled ``Coda`` in the
file ``stamitz``.

--------------

WARNINGS
~~~~~~~~

Where integer ranges are specified in the **yank** range-list,
overlapping values are collapsed. For example, the command
``yank -l -r 5-7,6-8`` is interpreted as equivalent to
``yank -l -r 5-8``; lines 6 and 7 will be echoed only once in the output
stream. If the user wishes to have multiple occurrences of material in
the output stream, the **yank** command can be invoked more than once
(e.g. ``yank -l -r 5-7 ...; yank -l -r 6-8 ...``).

Note that yanked segments cannot be output in an order other than their
order in the input. For example, assuming that measure numbers in an
input stream increase sequentially, **yank** is unable to output measure
number 6 prior to outputting measure number 5. Once again, the order of
output material can be rearranged by invoked the **yank** command more
than once (e.g.
``yank -l -r 100 ...; yank -l -r 99 ...; yank -l -r 98 ...``).

In the case of the **-m** option, note that range elements cannot
address records more than one marker away from the current marker. For
example, in a file where markers occur every 10 records, range
expressions such as ```25'`` and ```$-17'`` will result in no output. In
addition, range expressions such as ```1-25'`` and ```$-17-$'`` will
have the same effect as ```1-10'`` and ```$-9-$``. Note also that for
the same input file, the range expression ```6-$-7'`` will result in no
output.
