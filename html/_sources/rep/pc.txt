REPRESENTATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    **\*\*pc** -- pitch-class representation

DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~

    The **\*\*pc** representation can be used to characterize
    *pitch-class* or *chroma* information. Two pitches are said to share
    the same pitch-class or chroma when they are octave equivalents. No
    distinction is made between enharmonic spellings. Hence C-sharp4 and
    D-flat7 belong to the same pitch-class. In traditional set theory,
    pitch-classes are identified by integer values between 0 and 11,
    where C=0, C-sharp/D-flat=1 ... B=11.

    Three types of data tokens are distinguished by **\*\*pc**:
    pitch-class tokens, rest tokens, and barlines.

    Pitch-class tokens are encoded as either numeric, or mixed
    alphabetic and numeric values. Following traditional practice,
    **\*\*pc** encodes pitch-classes using the integer values between 0
    and 11, where C=0, C-sharp/D-flat=1 ... B=11. The **\*\*pc**
    representation provides aliases for the integers 10 and 11 (\`A' and
    \`B' respectively). (Encodings using purely numeric values are
    especially useful when the representation is to be processed
    numerically. Encodings using mixed alphanumeric values are often
    better suited to pattern matching and searching tasks.ยง) (ยง For
    example, where \`10' and \`11' are present in a stream of data, the
    regular expression to search for pitch-class \`1' is
    ``(^|[^1])1([^01]|$)``, whereas the corresponding regular expression
    for alphanumeric pitch-class data is simply ``1``.)

    In addition to the basic pitch-class information, **\*\*pc** also
    provides limited capabilities for representing articulation marks,
    ties, slurs, and phrasing. Slurs and phrase markings can be nested
    (slurs within slurs) and may also be elided. Nested markings mean
    that one slur or phrase is entirely subsumed within another slur or
    phrase. For example: ( ( ) ) means that a short slur has occurred
    within a longer slur. Elisions are overlaps, for example, where an
    existing phrase fails to end before a new phrase begins. In
    **\*\*pc** the ampersand character is used to mark elided slurs or
    phrases. For example: { &{ } &} means that a phrase begins, but does
    not end until after another phrase has begun. The ampersand is used
    to mark a matched pair of slur or phrases marks. Multiple levels of
    elisions are indicated by repeating the ampersand character. Both
    the beginning and ending must be marked by the same number of
    ampersands. For example, the following coding represents a series of
    elided phrases where three separate phrases begin before any of the
    phrases is terminated: { &{ &&{ } &&} &} Notice that the second
    elided phrase terminates after third phrase has ended.

    Rests are represented by the single letter \`r'.

    Barlines are represented using the "common system" for barlines --
    see `**barlines** <barlines.rep.html>`__.

FILE TYPE
~~~~~~~~~

    It is recommended that files containing predominantly ``**pc`` data
    should be given names with the distinguishing \`.pc' extension.
