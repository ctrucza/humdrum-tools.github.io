Humdrum Representation for Absolute Time
========================================

REPRESENTATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    **\*\*date** -- absolute time representation (year, month, day,
    hour, minute, second ...)

DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~

    The **\*\*date** representation provides a flexible means for
    specifying particular moments in historical time. The **\*\*date**
    scheme is able to represent year, month, day, hour, minute, second,
    and fractional second information. In addition, various degrees of
    approximation and uncertainty may be represented. N.B. Time-*spans*
    are not represented by **\*\*date**; see the
    `**\*\*dur** <dur.rep.html>`__, `**\*\*time** <time.rep.html>`__, or
    `**\*\*Zeit** <Zeit.rep.html>`__ representations.

    In the **\*\*date** representation, date information is encoded
    according to the following basic syntax:

    *year\ **/**\ month\ **/**\ day\ **/**\ hour\ **:**\ minute\ **:**\ second\ **.**\ decimal*

    Date information may be encoded in full, or may consist of isolated
    elements or parts. The following table shows the most succinct ways
    of encoding single date values within **\*\*date**:

        +------------+-------------------------------------+
        | ``.11``    | eleven one-hundredths of a second   |
        +------------+-------------------------------------+
        | ``11``     | 11th second                         |
        +------------+-------------------------------------+
        | ``11:``    | 11th minute                         |
        +------------+-------------------------------------+
        | ``11::``   | 11 o'clock                          |
        +------------+-------------------------------------+
        | ``11/``    | the year 11 A.D.                    |
        +------------+-------------------------------------+
        | ``@11/``   | the year 11 B.C.E./TD>              |
        +------------+-------------------------------------+
        | ``/11``    | November                            |
        +------------+-------------------------------------+
        | ``//11``   | 11th day of the month               |
        +------------+-------------------------------------+

        *Examples of **\*\*date** components*

    Notice that if a single numerical value appears, it is interpreted
    as *seconds*; if a single value appears followed by a slash, it is
    interpreted as a *year*; if a single value appears followed by a
    colon, it is interpreted as a *minutes*. Days and hours require two
    leading or two trailing delimiters respectively. In general,
    abbreviated forms of **\*\*date** representations tend to favor the
    two extremes of time: seconds and years. These are the time frames
    that are typically of greatest interest to music scholars.

    The **\*\*date** representation makes use of the Gregorian calendar
    and the 24-hour clock; Dates prior to the year 1 A.D. can be
    specified by prepending the "at" sign (``@``) to the year.

    The **\*\*date** representation provides three distinct means for
    representing approximate moments. It also provides two independent
    means for representing uncertainty, as well as mechanisms for
    representing time boundaries (prior to ...; after ...).

    If a date token is preceded by the tilde (~) signifier, the entire
    data token is taken to be *approximate.* Hence, the token
    `` ~1556/`` represents the approximate year 1556, whereas the token
    `` ~1901/9/1/`` represents approximately September 1st, 1901. When
    the lower-case letter \`x' appears in a data token, it indicates
    that only the adjoining numerical value is approximate. Hence, the
    token `` 1921/6x//`` means approximately June in the year 1921,
    whereas the token `` 1921x/6//`` means the month of June in the
    approximate year 1921. The \`x' may precede or follow a given value
    -- provided it is adjacent to the approximate value.

        `` 14:30x:``

    means *approximately 30 minutes* after 2 PM, rather than
    approximately 2:30 PM. In this case, only the value \`30' is
    approximate.

    A third method for representing temporal approximation employs the
    caret (^) to denote a range. For example, the **\*\*date** token:

        `` 1554/^1557/``

    represents a moment somewhere between the years 1554 and 1557.
    Conceptually, **\*\*date** is intended to represent *moments* rather
    than *periods* of time. In other words, the above token represents a
    moment sometime between 1554 and 1557; it is not intended to signify
    an event that spanned the years 1554 to 1557. **\*\*date** does not
    presume how long a moment "lasts," so it is theoretically possible
    to interpret 1554 to 1557 as a "long moment." However, another
    representation -- **\*\*Zeit (2)** -- is intended to represent
    *periods* of time, and so is better suited to the task of
    representing an ongoing state or condition. In **\*\*date,** the
    caret (^) is meant merely to provide a more precise means for
    specifying the degree of approximation. The following **\*\*date**
    tokens:

        `` 1954/6/1/^1954/6/2/  2.23^2.238``

    represent approximate times between June 1st and 2nd, 1954, and
    between 2.230 and 2.238 seconds respectively.

    In addition to methods for representing approximation, **\*\*date**
    also allows three methods for the encoding of uncertainty. General
    uncertainty is signified using the question-mark (?). A **\*\*date**
    token preceded by a question-mark indicates that the date
    information is *uncertain* (rather than imprecise). For example, the
    **\*\*date** token:

        `` ?1661/4//``

    represents the month of April, 1661 -- but indicates that this date
    is uncertain. When the lower-case letter \`z' appears in a data
    token, it indicates that only the adjoining numerical value is
    uncertain. This allows the user to be more specific about what
    aspect of the date is uncertain. For example, a composer's letter
    might be dated \`September 17th,' but historians may be uncertain of
    the precise year. This date might be encoded as:

        `` 1840z/9/17/``

    Note that uncertainty is not the same as approximation. Consider,
    for example, the contents of a letter dated simply "the 10th" that
    refers to especially hot summer temperatures. The letter is thought
    to have been written in 1932:

        `` 1932z/8x/10/``

    This representation indicates that the year 1932 is uncertain, that
    the month is approximately August, but that the date is definitely
    the tenth. As in the case of the \`x' signifier, the \`z' may
    precede or follow a given value -- provided it is adjacent to the
    uncertain value.

    A third method for representing uncertainty is provided by the
    **\*\*date** logical OR signifier (\|). As in the case of the
    logical BETWEEN (^), the OR signifier separates two component
    sub-dates. For example, the token `` 10:41:|11:41:`` means "either
    10:41 AM or 11:41 AM."

    In addition to the approximation and uncertainty signifiers,
    **\*\*date** also permits the encoding of time boundaries. The
    less-than sign (<) denotes "prior to" and the greater-than sign (>)
    denotes "after." For example, the data token `` <1100/`` means prior
    to 1100 A.D., whereas the token `` >21::`` means after 21 hours.

    Time boundaries can be mixed with approximation and uncertainty
    operators. Hence, the data token `` <5:30x:`` represents a time
    prior to 5 minutes and approximately 30 seconds. Similarly, time
    boundaries can be mixed with time ranges. Thus, the data token
    `` <1604/^1605/`` means before some time between 1604 and 1605.

    Note that > and < apply to entire date tokens (only one of > or <
    may appear in a given token). The signifiers ? and ~ can apply to
    subtokens (joined by the *BETWEEN* (^) or *OR* conjunction
    operators. The signifiers x and z apply to individual numerical
    values only.

FILE TYPE
~~~~~~~~~

    It is recommended that files containing predominantly ``**data``
    data should be given names with the distinguishing \`.dte'
    extension.
