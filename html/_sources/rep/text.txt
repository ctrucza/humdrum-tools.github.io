    **\*\*text** -- vocal text representation

DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~

    The **\*\*text** representation permits the representation of sung
    or spoken language. Only languages transcribable into the Roman
    alphabet can be represented using **\*\*text**. For non-Roman
    alphabets and non-language vocables, refer to the
    `**\*\*IPA** <IPA.rep.html>`__ representation.

    The **\*\*text** representation distinguishes three classes of data
    tokens: text-tokens, silence-tokens, and barlines.

    *Text-tokens* are of three types: syllabic, melismatic, and
    polysyllabic. A *syllabic* text-token means that a single syllable
    is associated with a single moment (such as a single pitch). A
    *melismatic* text-token means that a single syllable is associated
    with several successive moments (such as more than one pitch). A
    *polysyllabic* text-token means that several syllables are
    associated with a single moment (such as a single pitch).

    The simplest of these is the *melismatic* text-token -- which
    consist merely of a single vertical bar (\|). By itself, the
    vertical bar means that the previous syllable is sustained through
    the current moment. Syllabic and polysyllabic text-tokens are more
    complicated.

    In the **\*\*text** representation, text-tokens are
    syllable-oriented, so words must be broken-up into the component
    syllables. Words may be of three basic types: single-syllable words,
    multi-syllable words, and hyphenated words (e.g. the word
    "half-mast"). As a result, four types of syllables are
    distinguished: (1) a single-syllable word, (2) a word-initiating
    syllable, (3) a word-completing syllable, and (4) a mid-word
    syllable. In **\*\*text** the hyphen (``-``) is used to signify
    syllable boundaries; the tilde (``~``) is used to signify boundaries
    between hyphenated words (necessarily also a syllable boundary). The
    following table illustrates the how these signifiers are used:

        +----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
        | *text*         | a single-syllable word                                          |
        +----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
        | *text*-        | a word-initiating syllable                                      |
        +----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
        | -*text*        | a word-completing syllable                                      |
        +----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
        | -*text*-       | -d-word syllable                                                |
        +----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
        | *text*\ ~      | a single-syllable word beginning a hyphenated multi-word        |
        +----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
        | ~\ *text*      | a single-syllable word completing a hyphenated multi-word       |
        +----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
        | ~\ *text*\ ~   | a single-syllable word continuing a hyphenated multi-word       |
        +----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
        | ~\ *text*-     | a word-initating syllable completing a hyphenated multi-word    |
        +----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
        | -*text*\ ~     | a word-completing syllable -- part of a hyphenated multi-word   |
        +----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+

    A *syllabic* text-token consists of any one of the above tokens.

    Occasionally, it is useful to encode several syllables or words for
    a single moment (or pitch) -- as in the case of *recitativo*
    passages. In the **\*\*text** representation, such multi-word or
    polysyllabic text-tokens are encoded via Humdrum multiple-stops.
    That is, several words or syllables are encoded on the same data
    record, with each successive syllable separated by a space. The
    following encoding shows two syllables/words for each note:

        ````
        +-------------+---------------+
        | \*\*pitch   | \*\*text      |
        +-------------+---------------+
        | C4          | I saw         |
        +-------------+---------------+
        | A4          | a li-         |
        +-------------+---------------+
        | G4          | -ly beau-     |
        +-------------+---------------+
        | F4          | -ti- -ful ,   |
        +-------------+---------------+
        | \*-         | \*-           |
        +-------------+---------------+

    In the **\*\*text** representation, punctuation marks -- such as
    commas, periods, and exclamation marks -- are segregated from the
    syllable texts by a space. The period character is represented by
    the asterisk (``*``) in order to avoid the illegal construction of a
    period (null token) in a multiple stop. Five remaining punctuation
    marks are represented literally in **\*\*text**: comma (``,``),
    exclamation mark (``!``), question mark (``?``), colon (``:``), and
    the semicolon (``;``). When used in a melismatic context, an
    explicitly notated (printed) dash is represented by a double
    vertical bar (``||``). This signifies both the presence of a printed
    dash and the fact that the previous syllable continues to sound. In
    addition, double quotation marks (``"``) and parentheses (``()``)
    are also permitted. Once again, all such forms of punctuation must
    be segregated from the alphabetic text by the presence of a space.
    It is important to remember that periods are represented by
    asterisks.

    The **\*\*text** representation is intended to represent canonical
    language information rather than verbatim transcriptions of a
    printed score. Textual abbreviations and printing conventions such
    as *"etc.," "#"* and *"$"* must be expanded as: *et ce- -te- -ra,
    num- -ber,* and *dol- -lar* respectively (depending on the
    language). (If the user wishes to represent *text as printed,* an
    explicit **\*\*underlay** or **\*\*overlay** representation would be
    more appropriate.)

    Where greater subtlety is required for pronunciation, refer to the
    `**\*\*IPA** <IPA.rep.html>`__ representation.

    The original ASCII character set is regrettably hostile to
    non-English languages, especially with regard to accents. With the
    extended (international) ASCII set, French, German, and other
    accents are properly handled, but for English users, a given
    computer system may prove inflexible for non-English materials. In
    such cases, the **\*\*text** representation provides the following
    aliases to designate common accents. Accent signifiers are assumed
    to modify the immediately preceding Roman letter.

        +------+----------------------------+
        | /    | acute accent               |
        +------+----------------------------+
        | \\   | grave accent               |
        +------+----------------------------+
        | ^    | circumflex                 |

        +------+----------------------------+
        | 5    | cedilla                    |
        +------+----------------------------+
        | 6    | hacek                      |
        +------+----------------------------+
        | 7    | enya (tilde)               |
        +------+----------------------------+

        *Accent signifiers in **\*\*text***

    Musical phrasing can be explicitly represented in **\*\*text** via
    the open brace (``{``) and closed brace (``}``) for
    phrase-beginnings and phrase-endings respectively. Slurs can be
    represented via the open bracket (``[``) and closed bracket (``]``).
    Stressed and unstressed syllables can be explicitly denoted by
    prepending the plus sign (``+``) or the underscore (``_``)
    respectively -- at the beginning of the associated text.

    A handful of vocables can be represented via **\*\*text** including
    humming (signified by the upper-case letter \`M' by itself) and
    laughing (signified by the upper-case letter \`L' by itself). Tandem
    interpretation also permit encoding of the depth of vibrato and the
    degree of ennunciation. For example, shallow vibrato is indicated by
    ``*vibrato1`` whereas deep vibrato is indicated by ``*vibrato9``.
    Sloppy ennunciation is indicated by ``*ennun1`` whereas highly
    precise ennunciation is indicated by ``*ennun9``. Intermediate
    values can be used as needed.

    Apart from text-tokens **\*\*text** also permits the encoding of
    silence-tokens and barlines. Silence-tokens consist simply of the
    percent sign (``%``) appearing in isolation. This indicates the
    termination or absence of any vocal sound.

    Barlines are represented using the "common system" for barlines --
    see `**barlines** <barlines.rep.html>`__.

    Much vocal music is strophic in form -- containing two or more
    "verses" sung to the same musical setting. Abbreviated
    representations may take advantage of the Humdrum *strophe*
    mechanism to avoid duplicate encoding of melodies, etc. See
    `**strophe** <../commands/strophe.html>`__.

FILE TYPE
~~~~~~~~~

    It is recommended that files containing predominantly ``**text``
    data should be given names with the distinguishing \`.txt'
    extension.

    Notice that the first measure contains two Humdrum double-stops
    (``Once up-`` and ``-on a``). The double vertical bar (``||``)
    indicates that the word "upon" is explicitly divided by a notated
    hyphen. The word ``time`` is melismatic -- spanning two time-events.

PERTINENT COMMANDS
