The Humdrum Toolkit: Software for Music Research
================================================

Welcome
----------

Welcome to the website for Humdrum tools for computational
music analysis.  Here you will find instructions on downloading,
installing, and using the Humdrum Toolkit.

We've split the site into the `Humdrum User Guide <guide>`_ (Huron,
1995), an explanation of Craig Sapp's `Humdrum Extras <humextra>`_,
and a `Humdrum Cookbook <cookbook>`_.  While the original documentation
is transfered onto this website, you can vew the original HTML
documentation `here <Humdrum>`_.


What is Humdrum?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Humdrum is a set of command-line tools that facilitates musical
analysis. Because it's a set of command-line tools, it's program-language
agnostic. Many have employed Humdrum tools in larger scripts that
use PERL, Ruby, Python, Bash, LISP, and C++.

David Huron created Humdrum in the 1980s, and it has been used
steadily for decades.  We will be updating the site soon to include
a list of studies and publications that have used the toolkit.
