Humdrum Representation for Duration

REPRESENTATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    **\*\*dur** -- duration (time-span) representation

DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~

    The **\*\*dur** representation can be used to encode a sequence of
    time-spans or successive durations. Units may be seconds, minutes,
    hours, days, months, and/or years.

    In the **\*\*dur** representation, duration information is encoded
    according to the following basic syntax:

    *years\ **/**\ months\ **/**\ days\ **/**\ hours\ **:**\ minutes\ **:**\ seconds\ **.**\ decimal*

    Duration information may be encoded in full, or may consist of
    isolated elements or parts. The following table shows the most
    succinct ways of encoding single duration values within **\*\*dur**:

        +------------+---------------------------------+
        | ``.11``    | 11 one-hundredths of a second   |
        +------------+---------------------------------+
        | ``11``     | 11 seconds                      |
        +------------+---------------------------------+
        | ``11:``    | 11 minutes                      |
        +------------+---------------------------------+
        | ``11::``   | 11 hours                        |
        +------------+---------------------------------+
        | ``11/``    | 11 years                        |
        +------------+---------------------------------+
        | ``/11``    | 11 months                       |
        +------------+---------------------------------+
        | ``//11``   | 11 days                         |
        +------------+---------------------------------+

        *Examples of **\*\*dur** components*

    Notice that if a single numerical value appears, it is interpreted
    as *seconds*. For example, the data token `` 32`` represents a
    duration of 32 seconds. If a single value appears followed by a
    slash, it is interpreted as the number of *years*; if a single value
    appears followed by a colon, it is interpreted as the number of
    *minutes*. Days and hours require two leading or two trailing
    delimiters respectively. In general, abbreviated forms of
    **\*\*dur** representations tend to favor the two extremes of
    durations: in seconds and in years.

    The data token `` 1:15:10`` represents a duration of one hour
    fifteen minutes and 10 seconds. It is also possible to encode such
    durations in seconds alone as in the equivalent -- `` 4510.`` If
    only a single colon is encountered, it is presumed to delineate
    minutes and seconds as in `` 5:33`` (five minutes and 33 seconds).

    The data token `` 53/`` means an elapsed duration of 53 years,
    whereas `` /9//`` means a duration of 9 months. The data token
    `` //730/`` means 730 days.

    The **\*\*dur** representation provides a means for representing
    approximate durations. It also provides a means for representing
    uncertainty, as well as mechanisms for representing time boundaries
    (prior to ...; after ...).

    If a duration token is preceded by the tilde (~) signifier, the
    entire data token is taken to be *approximate.* Hence, the token
    `` ~1/`` signifies a duration of about 1 year and the token `` ~3``
    means a duration of about 3 seconds.

    If a duration token is preceded by the question mark (?), the
    duration is taken to be uncertain. Hence, the token `` ?3:``
    signifies a duration of perhaps 3 minutes.

    The **\*\*dur** representation does not support the \`x' and \`z'
    signifies used by related representations such as **\*\*date** and
    **\*\*Zeit.** However, **\*\*dur** is able to represent shorter-than
    (<) and longer-than (>) indications. For example, the data token
    `` <1:`` means a duration of less than one minute.

    Barlines are represented using the "common system" for barlines --
    see `**barlines** <barlines.rep.html>`__.

FILE TYPE
~~~~~~~~~

    It is recommended that files containing predominantly ``**dur`` data
    should be given names with the distinguishing \`.dur' extension.

    signifiers and signifieds.
