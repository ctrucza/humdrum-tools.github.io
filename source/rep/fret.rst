    **\*\*fret** -- generalized fretted tablature representation

DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~

    The **\*\*fret** representation provides a comprehensive system for
    representing performance aspects for fretted instruments. The
    **\*\*fret** scheme is suitable for representing tablature
    information for most fretted instruments, including: common 6-string
    and 12-string guitars, the 4-string bass guitar, lute, mandore,
    theorbo, chitarrone, mandoline, banjo, dulcimer, and viols. The
    **\*\*fret** interpretation is not limited to equal-temperament
    tuning, and so can be used to represent non-Western fretted
    instruments, such as the oud and the sitar.

    The **\*\*fret** representation is performance-oriented rather than
    notationally-oriented. Thus **\*\*fret** is not suitable for
    distinguishing different visual renderings -- such as traditional
    French or German lute tablatures. Special-purpose Humdrum
    representations should be used if the user's goal is to distinguish
    different forms of visual signifiers.

    The **\*\*fret** representation distinguishes three types of data
    tokens: tablature-tokens, rests, and barlines. In addition,
    **\*\*fret** provides three special-purpose tandem interpretations
    to specify more precisely the instrument's layout and tuning.

    The basic pitches produced by fretted instruments depend on three
    factors: (1) the relative tuning of the strings with respect to each
    other, (2) the absolute overall tuning of the instrument, and (3)
    the position of the frets. Three tandem interpretations allow the
    user to specify each of these aspects: `` *AT:`` (absolute tuning),
    `` *RT:`` (relative tuning), and `` *FT:`` (fret tuning). The
    absolute tuning and fret tuning have default settings,ยง (ยง The
    default absolute tuning is E2; the default fret tuning is one
    semitone for each successive fret.) however, the relative tuning of
    the open strings (``*RT:``) must be explicitly encoded in a
    **\*\*fret** spine.

    The absolute tuning of an instrument is indicated by encoding the
    pitch of the lowest string using the ``*AT:`` tandem interpretation.
    For the common six-string guitar, the lowest pitch is normally tuned
    to E2, and so would be encoded with the tandem interpretation: `` ``

        \*AT:E2

    The ``*AT:`` interpretation makes use of
    `**\*\*pitch** <pitch.rep.html>`__-type pitch designations and may
    also include cents deviation. For example, an instrument tuned 45
    cents sharp might be represented as `` *AT:E2+45.`` Encoding the
    absolute tuning of an instrument is optional in the **\*\*fret**
    representation.

    The tandem interpretation (``*RT:``) specifies the relative tuning,
    number, and arrangement of strings. Some instruments pair strings
    together in close physical proximity so that two strings are treated
    by the performer as a single virtual "string." Such paired strings
    are referred to as *courses.* For example, the 12-string guitar is
    constructed using 6 courses, and is played much like a 6-string
    guitar -- except that two strings sound together, rather than a
    single string.

    The ``*RT:`` tandem interpretation encodes the relative tuning of
    each string by specifying the number of semitones above the lowest
    string -- where each course is delineated by a colon (:). In the
    following encoding, the relative tuning of successive strings is 0,
    5, 10, 15, 19, and 24 semitones above the lowest string. This tuning
    defines the most common relative tuning for the six-string guitar --
    where successive strings are tuned above the lowest string by a
    perfect fourth (5 semitones), a minor seventh (10 semitones), a
    minor tenth (15 semitones), a perfect fifteenth (19 semitones), and
    a double octave (24 semitones). `` ``

        \*RT:0:5:10:15:19:24

    For non-Western and other instruments, it is possible to encode
    non-integer semitone values for various strings, such as a string
    tuned 9.91 semitones above the lowest string.

    When courses consist of more than one string, the relative tuning of
    each string in the course may differ. When encoding the relative
    tuning, each string within a course is separated by a comma (,) in
    the relative tuning interpretation. For example, a 12-string guitar
    is typically tuned as follows: `` ``

        \*AT:E2
         \*RT:0,12:5,17:10,22:15,27:19,19:24,24

    In this case, the lower four courses consists of two strings tuned
    an octave apart, whereas the upper two courses consist of paired
    unison strings.

    Historically, the 6-course *lute* was tuned in a variety of ways --
    the most common being the so-called *vieil accord* tuning: G2, C3,
    F3, A3, D4, and G4. From low-to-high, the courses are named bass,
    tenor, counter-tenor, great mean, small mean, and treble. During the
    first half of the 16th century, it was common to tune the lower
    three courses (bass, tenor, counter-tenor) in octaves. Hence, the
    relative tuning may be represented as follows: `` ``

        \*AT:G2
         \*RT:0,12:5,17:10,22:14,14:19,19:24,24

    Of course the absolute tuning of the lute was highly variable, so
    the lowest pitch would not necessarily be G2.

    In addition to the absolute and relative tunings, **\*\*fret** also
    allows the user to specify the tuning of successive frets. In
    Western instruments, frets are normally placed in semitone
    increments. For a 12-fret instrument, this semitone arrangement may
    be explicitly represented using the following tandem interpretation:
    `` ``

        \*FT:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12

    Each successive numerical value indicates the number of semitones
    above the open string for successive fret positions. The
    interpretation begins with the tuning of the first fret rather than
    the tuning of the open string. The above interpretation is similar
    to the *default fret tuning* -- which is an increase of precisely
    one-- itone for each successive fret. However, the above
    interpretation specifies only 12 frets, and so fret positions higher
    than 12 would be considered errors in the above encoding. An
    instrument constructed with 1/4-tone fret positions can be encoded
    as follows: `` ``

        \*FT:.5,1,1.5,2,2.5,3,3.5,4,4.5

    The only restriction imposed by ``*FT:`` is that all strings must
    have identical fret distances. That is, if the first fret is
    positioned 1 semitone above the open string, then this relative
    pitch arrangement must be true of all strings.

    *Tablature-tokens* encode information regarding the fret/finger
    positions, the manner by which individual strings are plucked (or
    bowed), pitch-bending, vibrato, damping, harmonics, and other
    effects. The actions of individual fingers can also be represented.
    Each tablature-token consists of a several subtokens in the form of
    Humdrum multiple-stops. Subtokens are delimited by spaces and
    represent individual courses/strings. A six-string (or six-course)
    instrument will require six subtokens in each tablature-token.

    Subtokens consist of up to five component elements: (1) the
    string/course status, (2) fret position, (3) bowing/strumming, (4)
    finger action, and (5) percussive effects. In addition, the
    tablature-token can encode bowing and strumming information.

    In the **\*\*fret** representation, the status of a string/course
    can occupy one of sixteen states: (1) inactive, (2) plucked, (3)
    plucked ponticello, (4) plucked sul tasto, (5) plucked tremolo, (6)
    pizzicato, (7) bowed, (8) bowed ponticello, (9) bowed sul tasto,
    (10) spiccato, (11) col legno, (12) bowed tremolo, (13) natural
    harmonic, (14) artificial harmonic, (15) ringing, or (16) damped.

    An *inactive* string is signified by the minus sign (-). An ordinary
    *plucked* string is represented by the vertical line (\|). Plucking
    near the bridge (*plucked ponticello*) is represented by the slash
    character (/). Plucking near the tone-hole (*plucked sul tasto*) is
    represented by the back-slash character (\\). The repeated
    *plucked-tremolo* (commonly used on the mandoline) is represented
    using the octothorpe or hash character (#). *Pizzicato* is
    represented by the small letter \`z'. Normal bowing of a string is
    represented by the plus sign (+); *ponticello* bowing is represented
    by the open parenthesis \`(' whereas *sul tasto* bowing is
    represented by the closed parenthesis \`)'. *Spiccato* (bouncing the
    bow) is represented by the open curly brace \`{'. *Col legno* (using
    the wood of the bow) is represented by the closed curly brace '}'.
    *Tremolo bowing* is represented by the ampersand (&). *Natural
    harmonics* and *artificial harmonics* are represented by the
    lower-case \`o' and upper-case \`O' respectively. String *ringing*
    is denoted by the colon (:), and the *damping* of a string is
    denoted by the small letter \`x'.

    By way of illustration, the following tablature-token represents a
    six-string/course instrument, where the first through sixth strings
    are respectively (1 and 2) plucked, (3) damped, (4) bowed, (5)
    plucked sul tasto, (6) inactive. `` ``

        \| \| x + \\ -

    Note that the layout of the strings in a tablature-token always
    corresponds to the tuning specified in the relative-tuning
    interpretation. In most representations, the lower-pitched strings
    will be toward the left side of the tablature token.

    *Bowing-direction* and *strumming* information is prepended to the
    beginning of the tablature-token. The direction of bowing/strumming
    is encoded using the left and right angle brackets: `` >`` means to
    bow/strum from the strings on the left side of the representation
    toward the strings on the right side of the representation. On most
    instruments this means strumming "downward" -- from the lowest- to
    the highest-pitched strings. The left angle bracket: `` <`` means to
    strum in the opposite direction. A rough indication of the speed of
    bowing/strumming can be represented by duplicating these signifiers.
    For example, `` >>`` means a slower "downward" bow/strum, and
    `` <<<`` means an especially slow "upward" bow/strum. The percent
    sign (%) is used to signify the so-called *rasgeado* -- or
    flamboyant Spanish strum. Once again these signifiers appear at the
    beginning of a tablature-token -- whenever they are encoded.
    Strumming all 6 open strings downward on a commonly-tuned guitar is
    represented as: `` ``

        \*AT:E2
         \*RT:0:5:10:15:19:24
         >\| \| \| \| \| \|

    Notice that there is no space between the right angle bracket and
    the first vertical bar.

    *Fret-position* information is indicated through the use of numbers,
    with the first fret signified by the number \`1'. Fret-position
    numbers are encoded immediately to the right of their respective
    string/course. For example, the following tablature-token encodes a
    six-string/course instrument in which the second and third strings
    are both stopped at the second fret. `` ``

        >\| \|2 \|2 \| \| \|

    The **\*\*fret** representation also permits the optional encoding
    of *fingering* information. For the plucking-hand (normally right
    hand), traditional musical abbreviations are used: *P* (pollex) for
    the thumb, *I* (index) for the index finger, *M* (medius) for the
    middle finger, *A* (annularis) for the ring finger, and *Q*
    (quintus) for the little finger. In addition, the lower-case letter
    *p* is used to signify the palm of the hand. Note that these letters
    are applied only to the \`plucking' hand. In the case of the
    \`fret-board' hand, the lower-case letters *a-e* are used to denote
    the thumb, index finger, middle finger, ring finger, and little
    fingers, respectively. Like the fret information, fingering
    information is encoded immediately to the right of the string to
    which the information applies. By way of illustration, the finger
    actions used in the above example may be made explicit as follows:
    `` ``

        >\|P \|2bP \|2cP \|P \|P \|P

    The strum is carried out by the thumb, while the index and middle
    fingers of the fret-hand stop the second and third courses/strings
    at the second fret. In the following continuation of this
    representation, the first course/string is replucked by the thumb.
    With the exception of the second and third courses/strings, the
    other strings are allows to ring. `` ``

        >\|P \|2bP \|2cP \|P \|P \|P
         >\|P xIM xIM : : :

    Notice that in damping the vibrations of the second and third
    strings, both the index and middle fingers of the \`pluck' hand are
    used on both strings.

    On rare occasions, guitarists will substitute fingers on the
    fret-board while a string remains sounding. The following example
    illustrates such a finger-substitution where the middle finger is
    replaced by the ring finger: `` ``

        \| \|2b \|2c \| \| \|
         : :2b :2d : : :

    Note that in the **\*\*fret** representation, no special signifiers
    are provided for so-called \`hammer-on' or (ascending-slur), nor for
    the so-called \`pull-off' or (descending-slur). During the
    ascending-slur, the sound is produced simply by engaging the next
    fret. This can be represented in **\*\*fret** by using the "let
    ring" signifier (:) in conjunction with the appropriate fret
    notation. The descending-slur can be similarly notated.

    The **\*\*fret** representation also provides several short-hand
    abbreviations for common ornaments and effects. Trills are indicated
    by the letters \`t' (one semitone) and \`T' (two semitones).
    Mordents are indicated by the letters \`m' (one semitone) and \`D'
    (two semitones). Inverted mordents are indicated by the letters \`w'
    (one semitone) and \`W' (two semitones). Turns are indicated by the
    letters \`S' and \`$' (for the inverted "Wagnerian" turn). Two types
    of vibrato are distinguished: \`v' for transverse vibrato and \`V'
    for lateral vibrato. Pitch bending is signified by the tilde (~).

    Four types of *percussion effects* can be represented using
    **\*\*fret.** The two most common *tambours* involve tapping on the
    bridge (represented by the lower-case letter \`u') and tapping on
    the strings near the bridge (represented by the upper-case letter
    \`U'). A simple \`tap' on the top-plate is represented by the
    lower-case letter \`y', whereas a lower-pitched \`thump' on the
    top-plate is represented by the upper-case letter \`Y'. When sounded
    alone, these signifiers appear on a record by themselves. When
    sounded in conjunction with a plucked or (uncommonly) bowed string,
    these signifiers appear at the beginning of the tablature-token.

    Apart from tablature-tokens, **\*\*fret** also permits the encoding
    of rests and barlines. Rest tokens are denoted simply by the
    lower-case letter \`r'.

    Barlines are represented using the "common system" for barlines --
    see `**barlines** <barlines.rep.html>`__.

    It is recommended that files containing predominantly ``**fret``
    data should be given names with the distinguishing \`.frt'
