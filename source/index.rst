The Humdrum Toolkit: Software for Music Research
================================================

Welcome
----------

Back up!
Welcome to the new website for the Humdrum tools 
for computational music analysis.
Here you will find instructions on downloading, 
installing, and using the Humdrum Toolkit.

We've split the site into the `Humdrum User Guide <http://humdrum-tools.github.io/humdrum-tools/guide/index.html>`_
(Huron, 1995), an explanation of the Craig Sapp's Humdrum
Extras, and a Humdrum Cookbook.


What is Humdrum?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Humdrum is a set of command-line tools that facilitates musical 
analysis. Because it's a set of command-line tools, 
it's program-language agnostic. Many have employed 
Humdrum tools in larger scripts that use PERL, Ruby, Python, Bash, LISP, and C++.

David Huron created Humdrum in the 1980s, 
and it has been used steadily for decades. 
We will be updating the site soon to include
a list of studies and publications that have used the toolkit. 


Getting Started
-------------------

At the moment, one of the better ways to install the 
Humdrum Toolkit is through Pedro Kroger's Github repository:
