The Humdrum Toolkit: Software for Music Research
================================================

Welcome
----------

Welcome to the homepage for Humdrum resources for computational
music analysis.  Here you will find instructions on downloading,
installing, and using the Humdrum Toolkit as well as other resoures.

We've split the site into the `Humdrum User Guide <guide>`_ (Huron,
1995), an explanation of Craig Sapp's `Humdrum Extras <humextra>`_,
and a `Humdrum Cookbook <cookbook>`_.  While the original Humdrum
website is transferred to one, you can view the original HTML
documentation `here <Humdrum>`_.


What is Humdrum?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

David Huron created Humdrum in the 1980s, and it has been used
steadily for decades.  Humdrum is a set of command-line tools that
facilitates musical analysis, as well as a generalized syntax for
representing sequential streams of data.   Because it's a set of
command-line tools, it's program-language agnostic. Many have
employed Humdrum tools in larger scripts that use PERL, Ruby, Python,
Bash, LISP, and C++.
