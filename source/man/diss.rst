Command: diss
================================


**diss** -- calculate the degree of sensory dissonance for successive
spectra

--------------

SYNOPSIS
~~~~~~~~

`` diss  [inputfile.spt ...] [> outputfile.dis]``

--------------

DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~

The **diss** command measures the degree of sensory dissonance for
successive acoustic moments. It outputs a single
`\*\*diss <../representations/diss.rep.html>`__ spine containing
numerical values -- where higher values indicate greater amounts of
sensory dissonance. The input must consist of one or more
`\*\*spect <../representations/spect.rep.html>`__ spines. Each data
record in the \*\*spect input represents a concurrent set of discrete
frequencies (spectrum). Spectral data consist of sets of paired
frequency/amplitude values for each pure tone component present. Typical
musical sonorities contain dozens of spectral components.

The **diss** command implements an algorithm arising from the work of
Kameoka and Kuriyagawa (see REFERENCES.) *Sensory dissonance* is a
low-level auditory phenomenon that is considered distinct from
culturally-mediated and contextual experiences of consonance or
dissonance (Greenwood, 1961; Plomp and Levelt, 1965). It is therefore
inappropriate to equate sensory dissonance with "musical dissonance"
broadly construed. Sensory dissonance values are known to be influenced
by the loudness, overall pitch-height, interval-relationship, and timbre
of any participating tones.

For a description of the input \*\*spect representation, refer to
Section 2 *(Representation Reference)* of this reference manual.

The output file format is dubbed \`.dis'

OPTIONS
~~~~~~~

The **diss** command provides only a help option:

        +----------+---------------------------------------------------------+
        | **-h**   | displays a help screen summarizing the command syntax   |
        +----------+---------------------------------------------------------+

Options are specified in the command line.

The **-k** option pertains to ``**kern`` inputs only. This option adds
``**kern``-related information to the output.

EXAMPLES
~~~~~~~~

The following example illustrates an input and a corresponding output
from the **diss** command. The first and second spines (\*\*spect)
encode a simple input spectrum consisting of six pure tone components.
The first component has a frequency of 261 Hz at a sound pressure level
of 47 decibels. The six components represent the pitches C4 and E4
played with 3 harmonics each. The third spine
(`\*\*diss <../representations/diss.rep.html>`__) displays the
corresponding sensory dissonance value as calculated by **diss.** An
output value of about 65 is typical for a single pure tone at about 60
dB SPL. An output value near zero results for silence.
