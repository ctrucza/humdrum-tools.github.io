COMMAND
~~~~~~~

**solfa** -- translate selected Humdrum pitch-related representations to
tonic solfa syllables (``**solfa``)

--------------

SYNOPSIS
~~~~~~~~

`` solfa  [-tx]  [inputfile ...]  [> outputfile.sol]``

--------------

DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~

The **solfa** command transforms various pitch-related inputs to the
corresponding tonic solfa syllables. The command outputs one or more
Humdrum ``**solfa`` spines -- where pitches are designated by the
syllables *do, re, mi, fa, so, la,* and *ti* -- or their chromatic
alterations: *di, da, ri, ra,* etc. (see below). Tonic solfa syllables
can be determined only with reference to some prevailing key. For
example, the pitch C is the tonic (``do``) in the key of C major, but
the mediant (``mi``) in the key of A-flat major. The **solfa** command
expects a tandem interpretation indicating the key of the input passage;
**solfa** will adapt to specified changes of key within an input stream.
If no key information is provided prior to the first pitch-related data,
**solfa** issues an error message and terminates.

There are various systems for extending the tonic solfa syllables in
order to representing chromatic alterations. The system used by
**solfa** is tabulated below. (Pronunciations are indicated in
parentheses.)

*Summary of **solfa** Signifiers*

The **solfa** command differs from the `**deg** <deg.html>`__ and
`**degree** <degree.html>`__ commands in that pitches are represented
without regard to major or minor *mode.* For example, in the key of C
major, **deg** and **degree** will characterize A-flat as a lowered
sixth scale degree, whereas the same pitch will be a normal sixth scale
degree in the key of C minor. In the case of **solfa,** the A-flat will
be characterized as ``le`` -- whether or not the key is C major or C
minor. As in the case of **deg** and **degree**, the amount of chromatic
alteration is not represented; once a pitch is "raised," raising it
further will not change the output representation. For example, where
the tonic pitch is B-flat, both B-natural and B-sharp are represented by
``di``.

The **solfa** command is able to translate any of the pitch-related
representations listed below. For descriptions of the various input
representations (including ``**solfa``) refer to Section 2
*(Representation Reference)* of this reference manual.

It is recommended that output files produced by the **solfa** command
should be given names with the distinguishing .sol extension.

OPTIONS
~~~~~~~

The **solfa**

command provides the following options:

    **-h**

    displays a help screen summarizing the command syntax

    **-t**

    suppresses printing of all but the first note of a group of tied
    notes

    **-x**

    suppresses printing of
    non-``**solfa signifiers  Options are specified in the command line. ``

    The **-t** option ensures that only a single output value is given
    for tied notes; the output coincides with the first note of the tie.

    In the default operation, **solfa** outputs non-pitch-related
    signifiers in addition to the degree value. For example, in the key
    of D, the ``**kern`` token "4Gz" will result in the output "4faz" --
    that is, after translating G to fa, the "4...z" signifiers are
    retained in the output. For some applications, echoing
    non-pitch-related signifiers in the output is useful. However, in
    other situations, the result can prove confusing. The **-x** option
    is useful for eliminating non-pitch-related signifiers from the
    output.

    EXAMPLES
    ~~~~~~~~

    The following example illustrates the use of **solfa.** The input
    contains four pitch-related spines -- one of which (``**MIDI``)
    cannot be processed by **solfa.** In addition, there is one
    non-pitch-related spines (``**embell``). ````

    Both processed and unprocessed spines are output. Notice that the
    tied note at the beginning of measure 2 in the ``**kern`` spine has
    been rendered as a single note rather than as two notes (due to the
    **-t** option). Also notice that the non-pitch-related signifiers
    (e.g. foo) in the first notes of the ``**pitch`` spine have been
    stripped away (due to the **-x** option).
