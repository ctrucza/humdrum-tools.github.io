Command: census
================================

**census** -- determine general properties of a Humdrum input

SYNOPSIS
~~~~~~~~

`` census  [-k]  [inputfile ...]``

--------------

DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~

The **census** command provides a summary of seven gross features of any
Humdrum input. It provides counts of the total number of records
(lines), the number of unique interpretations encountered, the number of
comments, the number of data records, the number of data tokens, null
tokens, and multiple-stops.

When the **-k** option is invoked, **census** provides a summary of a
further ten features pertaining to ``**kern`` inputs. This summary
includes the number of single and double barline records, the maximum
number of concurrent notes, the total number of note-heads, the total
number of notes (tied notes treated as single notes), the total number
of rests, as well as the longest, shortest, highest, and lowest notes
encountered.

--------------

~~~~~~~

The **census** command provides the following options:

        **-h**

        displays a help screen summarizing the command syntax

        **-k**

        also output information regarding
        ``**kern-related data   Options are specified in the command line. ``

        The **-k** option pertains to ``**kern`` inputs only. This
        option adds ``**kern``-related information to the output.

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        The following is a sample output where the **-k** option has
        been invoked. Without the **-k** option, the "KERN DATA" would
        be absent from the output.
