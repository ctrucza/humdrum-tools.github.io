COMMAND
~~~~~~~

**pitch** -- translate selected Humdrum pitch-related representations to
American standard pitch notation

--------------

SYNOPSIS
~~~~~~~~

`` pitch  [-tx]  [inputfile ...]  [ > outputfile.pit]``

--------------

DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~

The **pitch** command transforms various pitch-related inputs to the
corresponding pitch designations approved by the American National
Standards Institute (ANSI). The **pitch** command outputs one or more
Humdrum ``**pitch`` spines. ANSI pitch designations use the upper-case
letters A to G followed by an optional accidental, followed by an octave
number. In the Humdrum ``**pitch`` representation, optional cents
deviation from equal temperament can also be encoded.

The **pitch** command is able to translate any of the pitch-related
input representations listed below. In each case, a tuning standard of
A4 equals 440 hertz is assumed. For descriptions of the various input
representations (including ``**pitch``) refer to Section 2
*(Representation Reference)* of this reference manual.

It is recommended that output files produced using the **pitch** command
should be given names with the distinguishing \`.pit' extension.

OPTIONS
~~~~~~~

The **pitch** command provides the following options:

    +----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | **-h**   | displays a help screen summarizing the command syntax                          |
    +----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | **-t**   | suppresses printing of all but the first of a group of tied ``**kern notes``   |
    +----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | **-x**   | suppresses printing of non-pitch-related signifiers                            |
    +----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Options are specified in the command line.

The **-t** option ensures that only a single output value is given for
tied ``**kern`` notes; the output coincides with the first note of the
tie.

In the default operation, **pitch** outputs non-pitch-related signifiers
in addition to the ``**pitch`` pitch value. For example, the ``**Tonh``
token "Ges5zzz" will result in the output "Gb5zzz" -- that is, after
translating Ges5 to Gb5, the "zzz" signifiers are retained in the
output. For some applications, echoing non-pitch-related signifiers in
the output is useful. However, in other situations, the result can prove
confusing -- especially, when the non-pitch-related signifiers are
numbers. Consider the case of the ``**kern`` token "8aa#"; after
translating \`aa#' to A#5, the non-pitch-related signifier \`8' will
also be output, hence the value 8A#5 -- which may cause confusion;
commands such as `**tonh,** <tonh.html>`__ `**solfg,** <solfg.html>`__
and `**pitch** <pitch.html>`__ treat the first number encountered in an
input token as the octave designation. Hence further processing of this
token may lead to it's interpretation as A#8 -- or even A#58 -- rather
than A#5.

The **-x** option is useful for eliminating non-pitch-related signifiers
from the output. For most ``**kern`` inputs, the **-x** option is
recommended.

EXAMPLES
~~~~~~~~

The following example illustrates the use of **pitch.** The input
contains six pitch-related spines -- two of which (``**deg`` and
``**cocho``) cannot be processed by **pitch.** In addition, there are
two non-pitch-related spines (``**embell`` and ``**metpos``). ````

Both processed and unprocessed spines are output. Notice that the tied
note at the beginning of measure 2 in the ``**kern`` spine has been
rendered as a single note rather than as two notes (due to the **-t**
option). Also notice that the non-pitch-related signifiers (e.g. foo) in
the first notes of the ``**freq, **MIDI``, and ``**cocho`` spines have
been stripped away (due to the **-x** option). In the case of the
``**degree`` input, **pitch** recognizes the spelling of various pitches
in the context of the key of D minor. Hence, the raised third degree is
F#, and the raised sixth degree is B natural. Also note the presence of
cents-deviation from equal temperament in the translation of the
``**freq`` data (second spine).

FILES
~~~~~

The file ``x_option.awk`` is used by this program when the **-x** option

PORTABILITY
~~~~~~~~~~~

DOS 2.0 and up, with the MKS Toolkit. OS/2 with the MKS Toolkit. UNIX
