COMMAND
~~~~~~~

**midi** -- convert from ``**kern`` to Humdrum ``**MIDI`` format

--------------

SYNOPSIS
~~~~~~~~

`` midi  [-Ccu]  [-d n]  [-q n]  [inputfile.krn ...]  [ > outputfile.hmd]``

--------------

DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~

The **midi** command converts Humdrum ``**kern`` data into Humdrum
``**MIDI`` data. Humdrum ``**MIDI`` data may be played by the
`**perform** <perform.html>`__ command or converted to a standard MIDI
file using the `**smf** <smf.html>`__ command. The **midi** command will
translate all ``**kern`` spines in the input stream into ``**MIDI``
data, and will echo any non-kern spines.

It is recommended that output files produced using the **midi** command
should be given names with the distinguishing \`.hmd' extension
(\`Humdrum midi').

--------------

OPTIONS
~~~~~~~

The **midi** command provides the following options:

    +----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | **-c**   | echo all data records as global comments (prior to the data record)           |
    +----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | **-C**   | echo all data records as global comments (following the data record)          |
    +----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | -d *n*   | assigns a note-duration of *n* ``**recip`` value to all pitches and rests     |
    +----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | **-h**   | displays a help screen summarizing the command syntax                         |
    +----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | -q *n*   | set number of MIDI clock ticks per quarter-duration to *n*                    |
    +----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | **-u**   | suppress the deletion of duplicate (unison) concurrent note-on instructions   |
    +----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Options are specified in the command line.

If the **-c** option (\`comment') is invoked, all data records are
echoed as global comments in addition to the usual processing. This
option is useful in conjunction with the `**perform** <perform.html>`__
command; **perform** echoes all global comments while playing MIDI
inputs, and so the comment option allows the user to view the original
``**kern`` score while the music is performed.

The **-d** *n* option allows the user to reassign all the durations of
all notes and rests in a given input. The value *n* is specified in
reciprocal duration notation (``**recip``), where \`4' represents a
quarter-duration, \`2.' represents a dotted half-duration, \`12'
represents a quarter-note triplet, \`0' represents a breve, etc. (See
``**recip`` in Section 2 for details.) With the **-d** option all
pitches and rests in the input will be assigned the specified duration
value -- whether or not the notes already have encoded durations. This
option is useful for such tasks as proof-listening to passages
containing especially short notes, or auditing works -- such as
Gregorian chant -- where durations have not been encoded or are suspect
for other reasons. Note that the **-d** option should be used only in
the case of monophonic inputs, or multi-part inputs that contain
strictly isochronous chords. Polyphonic inputs containing
non-isochronous durations will cause a loss of synchronization between
the parts. The resulting output is apt to cause serious problems with
commands such as `**perform** <perform.html>`__ and
`**smf.** <smf.html>`__

In contrast to MIDI performance data, canonical musical scores (such as
``**kern``) frequently contain unisons -- where two voices share the
same pitch for a period of time. MIDI produces a \`note-off' instruction
at the end of each note; however only a single \`note-off' instruction
is required to turn-off a note. Unfortunately, the first note-off will
terminate a note -- even if the same pitch is sustained in another
voice. In normal operation, **midi** suppresses the sending of the first
of two MIDI \`note-off' commands when a unison is encountered in the
input. This ensures that the pitch will be sustained for the longer of
the unison durations. This feature can be disabled by invoking the
**-u** option.

The **midi** command assigns a default duration of 72 MIDI clock-ticks
per quarter-note. This default value may be reassigned using the **-q**
*n* option. The value *n* should be chosen so that all canonical
durations present in a given score divide evenly into it. For example,
the default value of 72 clock-ticks per quarter-note, means that
eighth-notes and sixteenth-notes will have durations of 36 and 18
clock-ticks respectively. Eighth-note triplets and sixteenth-note
triplets will have durations of 24 and 12 clock-ticks respectively.
Thirty-second notes will have a duration of 9 clock-ticks. But
sixty-fourth notes can cause synchronization problems since they do not
divide evenly into 72. The user may wish to reassign this value
depending on the types of canonical durations present in a given input.
Changing the default number of clock-ticks will affect the tempo of
performance when using the `**perform** <perform.html>`__ command.
Hence, it may be necessary to revise the tempo indication of a resulting
Humdrum midi-format file.

--------------

EXAMPLES
~~~~~~~~

The following examples illustrate how **midi** may be invoked.

    `` midi chopin > chopin.hmd``

converts the ``**kern`` data from the file ``chopin`` to ``**MIDI`` data
in the file ``chopin.hmd``. The command:

    `` midi -c siegfrd.idl > siegfrd.hmd``

translates the ``**kern`` data from the file ``siegfrd.idl`` to
``**MIDI`` data in the file ``siegfrd.hmd`` and echoes all ``**kern``
data as global comments.

SAMPLE OUTPUTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The operation of **midi** is illustrated in the following inputs and
outputs. In the first example, a simple C major scale is encoded in
``**kern``.

    +----------------------+

Executing the **midi** command with the default settings results in the
``**MIDI`` output given below. Notice that a default channel of MIDI
channel 1 has been assigned via the tandem interpretation ``*Ch1``. Note
also that each ``**kern`` note has resulted in two MIDI instructions:
"key-on" and "key-off". Since the end of one note coincides with the
start of the subsequent note, key-on and key-off data are output as
Humdrum double-stops (two tokens separated by a single space character).

``**MIDI`` data consist of three numbers separated by slashes (/). The
first integer represents the number of clock ticks that must elapse from
the previous instruction before the current event is initiated. In the
above case, a default value of 72 clock ticks per quarter-note has
resulted in 36 clock ticks for each eighth note. The second integer
represents the MIDI key number, where middle C is represented as key #60
(negative numbers denote key-off instructions). The third integer
represents the MIDI key velocity. The default key velocity is 64 units.

The second example illustrates the handling of input containing
multiple-stops. ````

Notice that non-kern data (``**harm``) is echoed in the output. Also,
notice that each input record has been reproduced as a global comment
(preceded by !!). This feature is useful in conjunction with the
`**perform** <perform.html>`__ command.

--------------

DIAGNOSTICS
~~~~~~~~~~~

The **midi** command echoes tempo indications for the benefit of the
`**perform** <perform.html>`__ command. If a tempo range is specified
(e.g. MM92-98), **midi** calculates the average range and echoes that
(MM95). Tempo terms (such as "largo") are not handled by **midi.**

--------------

PORTABILITY
~~~~~~~~~~~

DOS 2.0 and up.

PROPOSED MODIFICATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Channel assigment tandem interpretations (e.g. ``*Ch6``) should be
recognized in the input stream and cause the default channel 1 output to
be suppressed.
