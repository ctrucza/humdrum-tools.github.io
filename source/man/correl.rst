**correl** -- measure the numerical similarity between two Humdrum spines

SYNOPSIS
~~~~~~~~

`` correl  [-f templatefile]  [-m]  [-p n]  [-s regexp]  [inputfile ...]  [> outputfile.cor]``

--------------

DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~

The **correl** command measures the degree of parametric (numerical)
similarity between corresponding values in two Humdrum spines. More
precisely, **correl** calculates Pearson's coefficient of correlation
for paired tokens containing numerical data.

Two modes of operation are provided. In the *single input mode,* a
single file containing two equal-length spines is processed. In this
mode, the output from **correl** consists of a single number indicating
the linear correlation between the two spines of numerical data.

In the *dual input mode,* two single-spine numerical inputs -- called
the *template file* and the *input file* -- are specified by the user.
Normally, the template file is considerably shorter than the input file.
In this mode, the output consists of a spine of numerical information
(``**correl``) that reflects the momentary similarity between the
template and the input for each successive moment in the input. In
short, the input file is \`scanned' using the template values, and the
correlational similarity determined at each point.

In both *single input* and *dual input* modes, output numerical values
range between +1 and -1. Correlation values reflect the degree to which
two sets of numerical values rise and fall in synchrony. The maximum
output value is +1 -- indicating that the two sets of numbers are
perfectly related according to a linear relationship. -nimum output
value of -1 indicates that the two sets of numbers are perfectly
out-of-phase -- one set of numbers rises while the other set falls by a
proportional magnitude, and vice versa. A correlation value of zero
indicates that there is no linear relationship between the two sets of
numbers.

In *single input mode,* inputs to **correl** must consist of precisely
two spines; otherwise an error message is generated and the command is
terminated. The two spines may contain different interpretations and
represent different types of information. In the case of the *dual input
mode,* the input file and template file must have precisely one spine
each; the spines may differ in length, but the *template* file must not
be longer than the *input* file.

Only numerical signifiers are considered by **correl;** non-numeric
input data are ignored. Where a data token contains a mix of numeric and
non-numeric signifiers, only the first complete numerical subtoken
contributes to the calculation. The following examples illustrate how
**correl** interprets mixed data tokens:

    data token
    numerical interpretation
    ``4gg#``
    4
    ``4.gg#``
    4
    ``-33aa``
    -33
    ``-aa33``
    33
    ``x7.2yz``
    7.2
    ``a7..2bc``
    7
    ``[+5]12``
    5
    ``$17@2``
    17
    ``a1b2 c.3.d``
    1 0.3

Humdrum multiple-stops require special attention in **correl** (see
below).

In the *dual input mode* the output from the **correl** command consists
of a set of records matching the structure of the *input* document.
Output values indicate the correlation between the *template* data
values and the input data values beginning at that record.

When the *dual input mode* is invoked, it is recommended that output
files produced by the **correl** command should be given names with the
distinguishing \`.cor' extension.

OPTIONS
~~~~~~~

The **correl** command provides the following options:

    +---------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
    | -f *templatefile*   | specify source pattern as *templatefile* and             |
    +---------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
    |                     | invoke dual input mode                                   |
    +---------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
    | **-h**              | displays a help screen summarizing the command syntax    |
    +---------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
    | **-m**              | disable matched-pairs criterion                          |
    +---------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
    | -p *n*              | output precision to *n* decimal places                   |
    +---------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
    | -s *regexp*         | skip; completely ignore data records matching *regexp*   |
    +---------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+

Options are specified in the command line.

The **-f** option is used to specify an independent *template file* --
and so invokes the *dual input mode.*

The **-p** option can be used to set the precision of the output values
to *n* decimal places. The default precision is 3 decimal places.

The **-s** option allows the user to avoid (or skip) the processing of
certain types of data records. This option must be accompanied by a
user-defined regular-expression. Input data records matching this
expression are not processed.

Correlation values can be calculated only where all numerical data are
arranged as matched pairs -- that is, the input conforms to the "matched
pairs criterion." For example, the following two spines illustrate
numerical data matching. The number of numerical data values in both
spines are matched throughout the inputs: ````

    +--------------+--------------+
    | \*\*spine1   | \*\*spine2   |
    +--------------+--------------+
    | 10.0         | 4            |
    +--------------+--------------+
    | 7 3          | 2 .91        |
    +--------------+--------------+
    | .            | .            |
    +--------------+--------------+
    | 13.8         | 4            |
    +--------------+--------------+
    | 5 8 5        | 1 1 2        |
    +--------------+--------------+
    | a b c        | x            |
    +--------------+--------------+
    | .            | p q          |
    +--------------+--------------+
    | \*-          | \*-          |
    +--------------+--------------+

By contrast, the following file shows several transgressions of the
matched pairs criterion. For example, the first data record gives a
numerical value in spine #1 that is not matched by a numerical value in
spine #2. Similarly, the multiple-stop values in the second data record
are unmatched in spine #2: ````

    +--------------+---------------+
    | \*\*spine1   | \*\*spine2    |
    +--------------+---------------+
    | 9.7          | a             |
    +--------------+---------------+
    | 7 31         | 2             |
    +--------------+---------------+
    | .            | 114           |
    +--------------+---------------+
    | 426          | .             |
    +--------------+---------------+
    | r 11 7       | 35 xy08z 28   |
    +--------------+---------------+
    | a b c        | 6 .07         |
    +--------------+---------------+
    | .            | p q           |
    +--------------+---------------+
    | \*-          | \*-           |
    +--------------+---------------+

In normal operation, a single failure to conform to the matched pairs
criterion will cause **correl** to issue an error message and terminate
operation. If the **-m** option is invoked, unmatched data is simply
ignored. For example, with the **-m** option, the above input is treated
as equivalent to the following input: ````

    +--------------+--------------+
    | \*\*spine1   | \*\*spine2   |
    +--------------+--------------+

In order to avoid processing the measure numbers, the skip (**-s**)
option is used; executing the command:

    `` correl -s = bwv779``

will produce the following output:

    `` 0.979``

The second example illustrates the dual input mode. The target input
consists of a single spine (labelled `` **input)`` containing mixed
alphabetic and numerical values. (This input file is shown below as the
left-most column.) The template file consists of the numerical sequence:
1, 2, 3 -- mixed with the letters a, b, c. (This file is shown as the
middle column below.) Note that the non-numeric characters in both the
input and template files have no influence on the operation of
**correl.** The third (output) spine is produced by the following
command:

    `` correl -f template input > output.cor``

````

The similarity values generated by **correl** are given in the
`` **correl`` spine. Each successive value in the output spine is
matched with a data token in the target input file (``**foo``). For
example, the initial three output values (1.000) indicate that exact
positive correlations occur between the template and the input. That is
(0, 1, 2) (1, 2, 3) and (2, 3, 4) all show simple equidistant increases
corresponding to the source template. The final numerical value in
`` **correl`` shows a negative correlation (-1.000) indicating that the
numerical sequence (3, 2, 1) is the exact opposite contour to the source
template (1, 2, 3). By contrast, the immediately preceding output value
(0.000) indicates that the sequence (2, 3, 2) shows no systematic linear
relationship with the source template (1, 2, 3).

The following example provides a more complicated illustration of
**correl.** Once again the left-most column is the target input, the
middle column is the source template, and the right-most column shows
the corresponding output. ````

    +-------------+----------------+--------------+

The above output spine was created by executing the command:

    `` correl -m -s '[=r]' -f template input > output.cor``

Due to the **-s** option, all records in the input file containing an
equals-sign or lower-case \`r' are eliminated from the calculations. The
presence of the null-token in the third data record of the template file
is noteworthy. Although no correlations are calculated with the
null-token, it acts as a place-holder, and causes the corresponding
record in the input file to be ignored. For example, the first
correlation value is calculated on the basis of the following
coordination of numerical data: ````

    +-------+-------+
    | 1     | 1     |
    +-------+-------+
    | 2 3   | 2 3   |
    +-------+-------+
    | 100   | .     |
    +-------+-------+
    | 4     | 4     |
    +-------+-------+
    | 5 6   | 5 6   |
    +-------+-------+

Since the value \`100' is not matched with a numerical value in the
template, it is ignored in the correlation measure. (Note that without
the **-m** option, no output would be generated.)

At the next instant, the correlation value is calculated on the basis of
the following coordination of numerical data: ````

    +-------+-------+
    | 2 3   | 1     |
    +-------+-------+
    | 100   | 2 3   |
    +-------+-------+
    | 4     | .     |
    +-------+-------+
    | 5 6   | 4     |
    +-------+-------+
    | 0     | 5 6   |
    +-------+-------+

The double-stops do not form matched pairs, hence much of the data is
discarded. For example, in the first data record, 2 is matched with 1
but 3 is discarded. In the second record, 100 is matched with 2 but 3 is
discarded, etc.

The third correlation value is calculated on the basis of the following
coordination of numerical data: ````

    +---------+-------+
    | 100     | 1     |
    +---------+-------+
    | 4       | 2 3   |
    +---------+-------+
    | 5 6     | .     |
    +---------+-------+
    | 0       | 4     |
    +---------+-------+
    | -2 -3   | 5 6   |
    +---------+-------+

In this case, the correlation value is based on the following numerical
pairing: 100 <--> 1, 4 <--> 2, 0 <--> 4, -2 <--> 5, -3 <--> 6. All other
numerical values are ignored.

The final correlation value in this example is calculated on the basis
of the following coordination of numerical data: ````

    +---------+-------+
    | 4       | 1     |
    +---------+-------+
    | 5 6     | 2 3   |
    +---------+-------+
    | 0       | .     |
    +---------+-------+
    | -2 -3   | 4     |
    +---------+-------+
    | 8       | 5 6   |
    +---------+-------+

The corresponding correlation value is based on the following numerical
pairing: 4 <--> 1, 5 <--> 2, 6 <--> 3, -2 <--> 4, 8 <--> 5.

WARNINGS
~~~~~~~~

Correlation coefficients indicate only the magnitude of the association
between two sets of data. High correlation values can occur purely by
chance. The noteworthiness (statistical significance) of a correlation
value depends on the number of input values given in the template spine.
Novice users should consult a standard statistics textbook for further
advice on how to interpret the results.

For formal statistical measures, the **-m** option should never be
invoked.

If only one pair of matched values is present, the linear correlation is
mathematically undefined. In this case a question mark signifier is
output.

--------------

LIMITS
~~~~~~

The **correl** command is currently unable to handle input files greater
than about 4,000 records.

--------------

NOTE
~~~~

The **correl** command is also able to process simple columnated data
that does not conform to the Humdrum syntax.
