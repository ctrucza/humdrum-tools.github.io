Chapter 7: MIDI Output Tools
=================================

MIDI is a standard method for exchanging information between sound
synthesizers and controlling computers. Humdrum provides a number of MIDI-
related tools that allow MIDI data to be input and output. In this chapter we
will discuss the output-related tools: `**midi**`_, `**perform**`_,
`**smf**`_ and `**tacet**`_. MIDI input tools are discussed in `Chapter 30.`_


The ***MIDI* Representation
---------------

Humdrum provides a ```**MIDI```_ representation that closely parallels the
commercial MIDI specification but conforms to the Humdrum data format. This
representation provides an intermediate format; using Humdrum commands such
as `**perform**`_ and `**smf**,`_ true MIDI data can be generated. However,
since the ``**MIDI`` representation conforms to the Humdrum syntax, the data
can be manipulated, modified and searched in the same way as other Humdrum
data. For example, we can use **grep** to search MIDI data, etc.

MIDI is a type of "tablature" notation. It describes a set of performance
actions rather than specifying either the sounded result or the analytic
notation. MIDI represents note-related events for various "channels." MIDI
events include note-on, note-off, key-velocity, after-touch, control codes,
and system-exclusive codes. The original commercial MIDI standard is unable
to represent many other musically pertinent signifiers such as pitch spelling
(e.g., F-sharp versus G-flat), stem directions, ties, slurs, phrasing, etc.
In addition, MIDI does not represent rests.

A simple ```**MIDI```_ example is given below. It consists just a single note
(middle C):

``!! A single MIDI note.
``**MIDI
``*Ch1
``54/60/64
``80/-60/64
``*-``

Notice that there are two ``**MIDI`` data tokens: one to specify note-on and
one to specify note-off events. Each ``**MIDI`` data token consists of three
elements or components, delimited by a slash character (/). The first element
in the data token represents the number of clock ticks before the current
event is to occur. The absolute duration of a single clock tick is determined
by the ``**MIDI`` clock speed, which is variable. In our example, 54 clock
ticks elapse before the note is turned on, and another 80 clock ticks elapse
before the note is turned off. The initial pause before the first note begins
is not necessary; however, many MIDI cards introduce a brief delay before
beginning to send the first data in a stream. The leading pause prevents a
"rushed" burst of initial notes.

The second element in a data token represents the ``**MIDI`` key number.
Successive numbers refer to semitone pitches where middle C is designated key
``60``. Key-off events are represented by negative integers, so ``-60`` means
turn off key ``60``. Key numbers range between 1 and 127.

The third element in a data token represents the ``**MIDI`` key velocity.
MIDI instruments normally interpret key velocity as dynamic or accent
information. Higher key-velocity values are associated with accented notes.
In the case of key-off events, the key-velocity component represents the key-
up velocity.

Unlike most other Humdrum representations, the ```**MIDI```_ format requires
two data tokens for each note. The following example shows a three note
C-major triad. The `\*\*kern`_ data is shown in the left spine with the
corresponding ``**MIDI`` data in the right spine. Notice that each data token
consists of three subtokens, one for each note:

``!! A C-majortriad.
``**kern**MIDI
``**Ch1
``2c 2e 2g72/60/64 72/64/64 72/67/64
``.144/-60/64 144/-64/64 144/-67/64
``*-*-``

Middle C corresponds to MIDI key 60; The pitches E4 and G4 correspond to MIDI
keys 64 and 67 respectively. The half-note durations result in a delay of 144
clock ticks before the key-off commands are executed. Notice that all key-off
events occur simultaneously.

Suppose we add a second chord consisting of the dyad D4 and F4. The dyad
begins at the same time that the C major triad ends. This results in five
subtokens in the corresponding ``**MIDI`` data record. Three key-off events
are synchronous with two key-on events:

``!! Two chords.
``**kern**MIDI
``**Ch1
``2c 2e 2g72/60/64 72/64/64 72/67/64
``4d 4f144/-60/64 144/-64/64 144/-67/64 144/62/64 144/65/64
``.72/-62/64 72/-65/64
``*-*-``

Notice that the difference in duration between the half-notes and quarter-
notes is reflected when the notes are turned *off* rather than when the notes
are turned *on*.

Darius Milhaud's *Touches Blanches*.

The ```**MIDI```_ representation always expects a tandem interpretation
indicating the MIDI channel assignment. In Example 7.1 both parts have been
assigned to channel 1. Once again, simultaneous key-on and key-off events
often appear as double-stops. Also notice that an additional data record is
required at the end of the passage in order to turn off the final notes.


The *midi* Command
--------

The `**midi**`_ command converts Humdrum `\*\*kern`_ data into Humdrum
``**MIDI`` data. By way of example, the above ``**MIDI`` data can be
generated as follows:

``midi inven05.krn > inven05.hmd``

The ``.hmd`` filename extension is a common way of designating Humdrum
``MIDI`` data.

Since the \*\*kern representation does not encode key-velocity information,
the **midi** command assumes a default key velocity of 64 (from a range of 1
to 127). If the input is monophonic, **midi** will also allow the user to set
a fixed note duration using the **-d** option. This is useful for auditing
notes that do not have duration values. For example, a Gregorian chant might
be represented without durations. The following command takes a file
containing a 12-tone row (pitch information only) and produces a ``**MIDI``
output where all notes assigned to a quarter duration:

``midi -d 4 tonerow > tonerow.hmd``

The most common use of ``**MIDI`` data is to create a standard MIDI file
using the **smf** command, or to listen to the output using the **perform**
command. In some cases, it is useful to carry out processing of ``**MIDI``
data itself.


The *perform* Command
--------

The `**perform**`_ command allows the user to listen to synthesized
performances of ``**MIDI``-format input. When invoked, **perform** provides a
simple interactive environment suitable for proof-listening and other
audition tasks.

The **perform** command accepts any Humdrum input; however, only
```**MIDI```_ spines present in the input stream are performed. Non-MIDI
spines are simply ignored and do not affect the sound output. The **perform**
command generates serial MIDI data which are sent directly to a MIDI
controller card or on-board sound-card.

The **perform** command is typically the last command in a pipe preceded by
the **midi** command. For example, a \*\*kern-format score can be heard
using the following command:

``midi clara.krn | perform``

When invoked, the **perform** command reads in the entire input into memory.
This allows the user to move freely both forward and backward through the
MIDI score.

The **perform** command provides a set of interactive commands that allow the
user to pause and resume playback, to change tempo, to move to any measure by
absolute or relative reference, and to search forward or backward for
commented markers. The **perform** command remains active until either the
end of the score is reached or the user terminates performance by typing the
letter `q' or the escape key (ESC).

Playback can be paused by typing the space-bar and resumed by typing any key.
Typing the carriage return by itself will return to the beginning of the
score and re-initiate playback. If a number is typed before pressing the
carriage return then **perform** will search for a corresponding measure
number and initiate playback from that measure. Other commands are provided
that allow moving forward or backward a specified number of measures.

In the default operation, **perform** echoes all global comments on the
screen as the comments are encountered in the input. For inputs containing
appropriate annotations, the echoing of comments can provide useful visual
markers or reminders of particular moments in the sound output. Whether or
not global comments are echoed on the standard output, users can use the
**perform** forward-search (``/``) or backward-search (``?``) commands to
move directly to a particular commented point in the score. For example, if
an input contains a global comment containing the character string "``Second
theme``," then the user can move immediately to this position in the input by
entering the following command:

``/Second theme``

Similarly, backward searches can be carried out by typing the question mark
(``?``) rather than the slash. If the search is successful, playback
continues immediately from the new score position.


Data Scrolling During Playback
------------------------------

The **midi** command provides a useful **-c** option that causes each data
record to be repeated as a comment. For example, when the **-c** option is
used a sequence of data records such as the following:

``4C4E4G4c
``4D4F4G4B
``4AA4E4A4c``

is transformed to:

``4C4E4G4c
``!!4C4E4G4c
``4D4F4G4B
``!!4D4F4G4B
``4AA4E4A4c
``!!4AA4E4A4c``

Since, by default, the **perform** command echoes all global comments on the
screen during playback, this means that the Humdrum data will also appear on
the screen as it is being played. In addition, the commented data records are
accessible to the forward- and backward-search commands. For example, in the
`\*\*kern`_ representation, pauses are indicated by a semicolon; hence the
user might search for the next pause symbol by typing:

``/;``

Similarly, the user could search for a particular pitch, e.g.

``/gg#``

Since the **perform** command accepts any Humdrum input, other Humdrum data
may be used for searching. For example, the input data might contain melodic
interval data (see `Chapter 11`_), allowing the user to search for a
particular interval such as a diminished octave:

``/d8``

If the string pattern is found in the input, **perform** will move
immediately forward (or backward) to the next occurrence and begin playing
from that point.


Changing Tempo
--------------

During playback, the tempo can be modified by typing the greater-than (>) and
less-than (<) signs to increase or decrease the tempo respectively. In
addition to modifying the tempo interactively, the performance tempo may be
specified either in the command line or in the input Humdrum representation.
The tempo may be specified on the command line by using the **-t** option.
For example, the following command causes the file ``Andean`` to be performed
at half tempo:

``midi Andean | perform -t 0.5``

Performing at fast speeds can often be useful when scanning for a particular
passage.

Tempo specifications may be present in the input data via the tandem
interpretation for metronome marking (e.g. ``*MM96``). If no tempo
information is available, **perform** uses a default tempo of 66 quarter-
notes per minute.


The *tacet* Command
--------

In rare circumstances, ciphers (stuck notes) can occur during MIDI
performances; for instance, an intermittently functioning MIDI cable may fail
to convey a "note-off" instruction to an active synthesizer. The **p**
command ("panic") turns off all active notes. Should a cipher remain after
terminating the **perform** command, the Humdrum `**tacet**`_ command can be
used to send "all-notoff" commands on all MIDI channels.

In `Chapter 12,`_ we will see how **perform** can be used in conjunction with
other commands (such as `**extract**`_ and `**yank**`_) to listen selectively
to specific parts or passages. In `Chapter 21`_ we will use **perform** in
conjunction with the `**patt**`_ command to listen to patterns (such as
harmonic, rhythmic and melodic patterns) found in some repertory.


The *smf* Command
--------

Another MIDI-related tool is the `**smf**`_ command. This command allows the
user to create "standard MIDI files" from Humdrum ``**MIDI``-format files.
Standard MIDI files are industry-standard binary files that can be imported
by a variety of MIDI applications software packages on many different
platforms, including sequencer programs and most music notation packages.

The **smf** command translates only ``**MIDI`` input spines; all
non-``**MIDI`` spines are simply ignored. Suppose we begin with a
\*\*kern-format file named ``joplin``. We can create a standard MIDI file
as follows:

``midi joplin | smf > joplin.smf``

The **smf** command provides two options. The **-t** option allows the user
to set the tempo, whereas the **-v** option allows the user to specify a
default MIDI key velocity. See the *Humdrum Reference Manual* for details.

Reprise
-------

In this chapter we have learned how Humdrum data can be output as MIDI data.
Humdrum provides a ``**MIDI`` representation that closely parallels MIDI but
remains in conformity with the Humdrum syntax. This means that the data can
still be processed with other Humdrum tools (as we will see in later
chapters).

The `**midi**`_ command can translate `\*\*kern`_ data to ```**MIDI```_ and
the `**perform**`_ and `**smf**`_ commands can be used to generate true MIDI
data for listening. The **perform** command provides a simple interactive
command-line sequencer for playing whatever input is provided. The **smf**
command generates standard MIDI files that can be used to transport MIDI data
to a vast array of commercial and non-commerical applications software. In
`Chapter 30`_ we will explore some of the Humdrum tools for inputting MIDI
data into Humdrum.
