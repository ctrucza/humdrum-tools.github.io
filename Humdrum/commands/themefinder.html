<H2>Themefinder - General Documentation</H2></FONT>
<HR WIDTH=500></center>

<P>
This documentation describes utilities and procedures
for constructing, maintaining and augmenting the
<i>themefinder</i> musical databases.
</P>

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.themefinder.com">Themefinder</A>
is a web-based application that allows
users to search for musical themes and incipits.
Users may search using a variety of search-keys,
including pitch contour, scale degree,
date-of-composition, etc.
</P>

<P>
When a search is executed, a "results-page" is generated
listing all of the themes that match the search criterion.
If more than 10 themes are found, the results are distributed
over two or more results-pages, with 10 themes presented on
each page.
</P>

<P>
The results for each theme consist of a <i>text header</i>
that reports basic information such as composer and title,
and a notational rendering (displayed using a .gif image file).
In addition, users can select the [M] button which
causes a MIDI sound (.mid) file to be downloaded for listening.
Also, a [I] button can be selected which causes a new
page to be displayed containing detailed reference information
pertaining only to one particular theme.
This reference information is stored in a .inf file.
</P>

<H3>Theme Files</H3>
<P>
Each theme is represented by a single
<A HREF="../guide05.html">Humdrum</A>
file, designated with the ".thm" file extension.
A theme file normally contains a single
<A HREF="../representations/kern.rep.html">**kern</A>
spine representing some theme or incipit.
If more than one **kern spine is present, only the left-most
spine is used for searching purposes.
</P>

<P>
Other spines may be present in theme files,
such as spines for encoding lyrics/text
(<A HREF="../representations/silbe.rep.html">**silbe</A>,
<A HREF="../representations/text.rep.html">**text</A>),
harmonic function
(<A HREF="../representations/harm.rep.html">**harm</A>),
or another other information.
Currently, such non-kern encodings are ignored by the
<i>themefinder</i> search engine,
however future proposed extensions will make use of
such information.
Users may view the complete Humdrum theme file
using the [H] links displayed on any search-results page.
</P>

<P>
Each theme file also contains a number of Humdrum
<A HREF="../guide.append1.html">Reference Records</A>
that are used for bibliographic,
text, or reference-related searching.
Theme files should minimally contain reference records
identifying the
<A HREF="../guide.append1.html#COM">composer</A> (!!!COM) and
<A HREF="../guide.append1.html#OTL">title</A>
(!!!OTL).
Additional reference records are welcome and desireable.
Global and local comments can also be included,
and are encouraged when they clarify aspects of the
encoded music.
</P>

<P>
A special reference-formating record (!!!ref)
must be present in each theme file.
The purpose of this record is to instruct <i>themefinder</i>
how to format the header text which appears
immediately above the notated theme when displaying a
search-results page.
The following two headers illustrate typical header texts:
<blockquote>
Beethoven, Ludwig van, <i>Pathetique Sonata</i>, Opus 13, No. 1.
<br>
Anon. <i>Mrs. Brown's Owl</i>, Traditional English Ballad.
</blockquote>
The format for a given theme header is specified by indexing other
reference information contained in the file.
Consider, for example, the following record:
<blockquote>
!!!ref:  @{COM}, &#60;i&#62;@{OTL}&#60;/i&#62; (@{XEN})
</blockquote>
This record indicates that the !!!COM (composer) information
should be displayed, followed by a comma, followed by a space,
followed by the original title (!!!OTL), followed by the English
translation of the title (if present) given in parentheses.
The &#60;i&#62; ... &#60;/i&#62; surrounding the original title is the HTML
(hypertext markup language) code for rendering text in italics --
hence the title will appear italicized.
</P>

<H3>ISTN Numbers</H3>
<P>
Themefinder accesses themes by a numerical identifier called
an Internal Standard Theme Number (ISTN).
An original theme file might be named "webern31a.thm",
but this file is ultimately copied to something like
122293375723.thm.
A single number is used to identify all of the pertinent
theme-related files.
For example, the corresponding MIDI, notational image,
and reference information files would be named 122293375723.mid,
122293375723.gif and 122293375723.inf.
</P>

<P>
The main purpose of ISTN numbers is security.
Since these files are directly accessible to the world wide web,
it is possible that someone might attempt to retrieve and copy the
entire database.
The ISTN numbers are intentionally very large, and randomly generated.
Consequently, the ISTN numbers are "sparse":
it is very unlikely that any given number corresponds to an
actual file.
This means that automated web requests for a particular numerical
file are unlikely to fetch an actual file.
Multiple attempts to fetch many files will alert us to
attempts at database theft
before a remote site is able to download many actual files.
</P>

<P>
ISTN numbers are stored in the /themefinder/istn/allocation/
directory.
The file <i>free.istn</i> identifies randomly generated numbers
that are available for use.
The file <i>used.istn</i> contains a list of numbers that are
already in use.
</P>

<H3>Adding Themes</H3>
<P>
In order to add themes to the themefinder database,
the user must first encode a Humdrum **kern file (.thm)
for each individual theme or incipit.
From this original file,
the user must generate three additional file types:
a notation image (.gif) file, a MIDI sound (.mid) file,
and a reference information (.inf) file.
Detailed instructions for generating each type of file are given below.
</P>

<P>
Themes are usually stored in groups called <i>collections</i>.
An example of a collection is the Essen Folksong Collection.
Sometimes individual theme files are added to an existing collection.
Frequently, whole new collections consisting of hundreds of
themes are added.
Each collection is stored in a separate directory.
</P>

<P>
Themes are also classified according to <i>repertory</i>.
Examples of repertories included "classical" music,
"folk" music, and "chant".
A repertory may consist of several collections.
Repertoires are used by <i>themefinder</i> to limit the search
to particular types of works.
</P>

<H3>Generating Image Files (.gif)</H3>
<P>
The notational images (.gif) files are generated
via the Humdrum <A HREF="ms.html">ms</A> command,
which in turn makes use of the
<i>Mup</i> music typesetting utility.
The <i>ms</i> command generates postscript output.
A further program (<i>ps2gif</i>) translates postscript files to gif,
crops the image to a suitable size, and
makes the image transparent so any HTML background can
appear behind the notation.
</P>

<P>
Normally, the entire process of generating a .gif file is
completely automated (see below).
That is, the user normally need not invoke the <i>ms</i>,
the <i>mup</i> or <i>ps2gif</i> commands.
However, limitations in the <i>ms</i> command often generate
errors using <i>Mup</i>, and so some .gif files must be
produced manually.
In this case, invoke the <i>ms</i> command with the <i>-z</i>
option so that an intermediate .mup file is generated.
Edit this file until it conforms fully to the Mup input syntax.
Then use the <i>mup</i> and <i>ps2gif</i> commands to generate
an appropriate .gif file.
For details, refer to the documentation for the
<A HREF="ms.html">ms command</A>.
</P>

<H3>Generating Information Files (.inf)</H3>
<P>
The info (.inf) files provide essential indexing information.
A typical info file is shown below:
<blockquote>
@START: INFO
<br>
@THEME: albinoni-01-01
<br>
@REPERTOIRE: classical
<br>
@COLLECTION: lvh
<br>
@ISTN: 122293375723
<br>
@DESCRIPTION: Albinoni, Toaso Givanni: &#60;i&#62;Sonata 1&#60;/i&#62; Op. 1 No. 1
<br>
@MOVEMENTSNS:
<br>
@SINGLESNS:
<br>
@WORKSNS:

@COLLECTIONSNS: 122293375723 0596234234 23409234098243 234098230498234 23409834059345 5069243098534098 234098340598345 23049834059834
<br>
[other themes that are related by collection]
<br>
@LINKTHEME: [points to numbered files that contains web link to this theme]
<br>
@LINKMOVEMENT: [points to numbered files that contains web link to this movement]
<br>
@LINKWORK: [points to numbered files that contains web link to this work]
<br>
@LINKCOLLECTION: [points to numbered files that contains web link to this collection]
<br>
@END: INFO
</blockquote>
The @THEME record identifies the name of the original theme file
(without the .thm extension).
In the above case, the corresponding theme file is
<i>albinoni-01-01.thm</i>.
The @REPERTOIRE record identifies the larger repertory to which
the work belongs.
As noted above, repertoires are
used by <i>themefinder</i> to limit the search to particular
types of works.
The @COLLECTION record identifies the <i>collection</i>
to which the theme belongs.
The @ISTN is the unique numerical identifier used by <i>themefinder</i>
to identify the particular theme.
The @DESCRIPTION record holds the literal theme header
(including HTML codes)
that appears above the notated theme when the search results are displayed.
</P>

<P>
The @MOVEMENTSNS record is used to identify
possible other themes that may appear in a single movement;
these are indicated using the ISTN numbers for each theme.
The @SINGLESNS record is currently not used.
It is intended to identify single movement works.
The @WORKSNS record is used to identify all
themes in the same work -- that is, all themes from all movements.

<H3>FILES</H3>
<P>
Theme files are normally processed in groups (typically by <i>collection</i>).
Each collection is located under the main /themefinder/collections
directory.
Examples of collections subdirectories include /lmotet/
(Latin motets), /essen/ (Essen Folksong Collection),
/asm/ (Library of Congress, American Sheet Music collection),
and /densmore/ (Francis Densmore Native American music collection).
</P>

<P>
Under each particular collection, there is a /source/ subdirectory
which contains all the Humdrum theme (.thm) files.
Since collections typically contain large numbers of themes,
the /source/ directory
is further divided into alphabetized subdirectories
(/a/, /b/, /c/, ... /z/).
The themes are distributed in these lettered subdirectories
according to any scheme the user chooses.
For example, one might choose to order the themes alphabetically
by composer.
The purpose is simply to avoid theme source directories containing
an unmanageable number of files.
</P>

<P>
Under each particular collection there is also an /info/ subdirectory
which contains all of the information (.inf) files.
As in the case of the /source/ directory, the /info/ directory
contains alphabetized subdirectories (/a/, /b/, etc.) whose purpose
is (once again) to avoid excessive numbers of files in a single directory.
The directory structure for /info/ duplicates exactly that for
the /source/ directory.
</P>

<P>
Another subdirectory included for each collection is the
/bib/ directory.
This directory contains a series of files named
<i>a.bib</i>, <i>b.bib</i>, <i>c.bib</i>, etc.
Each .bib file contains one record (line) for each file
in the corresponding /source/<i>n</i> directory.
For example, if /source/lvh/a contains 25 themes, then
the file /source/bib/a.bib will contain 25 lines.
Each record in the .bib file begins with the ISTN number,
followed by a tab.
All reference records in the theme file are then appended,
with each reference record separated by a tab.
In other words, all reference records for a single theme file
are amalgamated and placed on a single line -- one line for
each theme file.
(Note that single lines may contain several hundred characters.)
E.g.
<blockquote>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD>020000000100</TD><TD>!!!COM: Albinoni, Tomaso Giovanni</TD><TD>etc.
</TR>
</TABLE>
</blockquote>
The .bib files are used when searching for reference-related
information using <i>grep</i>.
</P>

<P>
Yet another subdirectory included for each collection is
the /istn/ directory.
This directory contains a single file (all.istn).
This file is in the Humdrum format and consists of four spines:
**repertory, **collection, **theme, and **istn.
Each data record pertains to a single theme in the collection.
The record specifies the repertory assignment, the collection name,
the file name for the original theme file (minus the .thm extension),
and the ISTN number.
A sample file is given below:
<blockquote>
<table>
<TR>
	<TD>**repertory</TD><TD>**collection</TD><TD>**theme</TD><TD>**istn</TD>

<H3>Web Links</H3>
<P>
Themefinder provides opportunities for web-users to
attach links from a specific theme to a particular
web page -- anywhere on the world-wide web.
This allows, for example, a scholar who has written
a web document pertaining (say) to the Mozart Symphony 41,
to provide a web links from all of the pertinent themes
to his/her web document.
</P>
<P>
Links are established by using a special HTML "links"
form which is accessed through the [L] button on
the theme information page.
When the form is submitted, a link file is
created, the syntax for which is illustrated below.

A submitted link generates a file in
which is stored in the
/themefinder/links/submitted
directory.
As in the case of other themefinder files, link filenames
are assigned a large random number.
Link filenames always begins with the number 9.
The number is generated by a combination of date/time and random numbers.
</P>
<P>
When a submitted link is processed, the file is moved to the
"process" subdirectory, edited, and then the "make process" command
is executed from the "links" directory.
This causes the modification of any pertinent INFO file, and copies
the submitted-link file to the link storage directory (/9/ directory ).
It also updates a list/all.lst file which contains a list of all of
the link files, ordered from oldest to most recent submitted link.
(This list is used in the cgi-bin/themenewlinks script to allow viewing
of the most recently added links to themefinder.

<H2>How to Build a Themefinder Database</H2>
<P>
Suppose we have 1,000 new themes that we have assembled
or translated from a donated database.
We can generate the appropriate files and integrate
the themes in themefinder as follows.
</P>
<P>
Presuming that the themes warrant a new "collection"
we would create a new subdirectory under /collections/.
E.g.
<blockquote>
mkdir /collections/ragtime
</blockquote>
Provide edited Humdrum files containing the themes.
These files may contain any Humdrum spines, but must
contain a **kern spine.  (Only the first **kern spine
is used in generating music-related indexes.)
In addition, create a serious of 26 alphabetic subdirectories
and distribute the files throughout these directories.
(The distribution is arbitrary.)
<blockquote>
mkdir /collections/ragtime/a
<br>
mkdir /collections/ragtime/b
<br>
mkdir /collections/ragtime/c
<br>
etc.
</blockquote>
</P>
<P>
For a new collection, copy the "Makefile" from one of
the existing collections to the new collection:
E.g.
<blockquote>
cp /collections/essen/Makefile /collections/ragtime
</blockquote>
Change to the /themefinder/istn directory and run the "make"
command (?Craig is this correction?).
Make the ISTN index (/istn/all.istn) file, getting free ISTN numbers
from the /themefinder/istn/allocation/free.istn.
Remember to eliminate
these numbers from free.istn and copy them to used.istn.

Hi David,
</P>
<P>
The Themefinder description on the additional commands page
is pretty accurate.  Here are the couple of statements I found
that need correcting/elaboration:
</P>
<P>
> Also, a [I] button can be selected which causes a new page to
> be displayed containing detailed reference information pertaining only
> to one particular theme. This reference
> information is stored in a .inf file. 
</P>
<P>
.inf files only store Themefinder-specific maintenance records which
are generated automatically from other data and would look too ugly to
place into the .thm files.  Instead, all available reference
information on the information page of a theme is stored in the
original .thm file:
</P>
<P>
>> Also, a [I] button can be selected which causes a new page to
>> be displayed containing detailed reference information pertaining only

>> .thm theme file. 
</P>
<P>
===========================
</P>
<P>
> but this file is ultimately copied to something like 122293375723.thm.
</P>
<P>
This is somewhat true.  There are two directory structures currently
in Themefinder: (1) for each independent collection of themes where
the names are preserved from the submitter, and (2) one enourmous
file structure with 11,111 directories, or so, which store symbolic
links to the real collection files.
</P>
<P>
Directory structure (2) is used by the web CGI-scripts to access the
themes in a uniform manner, but Directory structure (1) is used for
storage of the themes.  It would be possible to distribute directory
structure (2) with the web CGI interface files in a portable fashion 
to other computers for mirror websites of Themefinder.
</P>
<P>

<P>

<P>
A secondary purpose of ISTN numbers is to provided a uniform access to
independently named collection sets and allow possible interaction
between independent collection sets with an easier way of writing the
supporting code for theme access.

Hi David,
</P>
<P>
Here is the outline of a set of guidelines for Themefinder maintenance
and theme collection additions to Themefinder that would be good to generate:
<ul>
<li>
Section I is documentation to give out to prospective theme donors.
<li>
Section II is documentation on how to incorporate the themes into
Themefinder by the Themefinder staff.
<li>
Section III is other sorts of documentation not covered in Sections I
and II.
</ul>
</P>
<P>
I have written a draft of Section I for you to elaborate/expand on if you
like.  John Howard might be interested in having this sort of documentation.
</P>
<P>
Sometime soon I will go though adding a theme collection step-by-step
and describe the process in detail and accurately.  The current web
documentation describes much of the process but would not be complete
for someone who hasn't done the process.
</P>
<P>
And the left-over parts of the documentation not covered in sections
I and II can go into documentation tentatively outlined in section
III.

<center>
<H2>Submitting Theme Collections to Themefinder</H2>
</center>

<P>
There are two general stages to adding themes to themefinder: 
(I) creating theme files with musical and bibliographic data, as well 
as a theme grouping file that contains relations between themes; and 
(II) installing theme data files and generating supporting files.
</P>

<H3>I. Original Data Files.</H3>

<H3>I.A. Theme files.</H3>

<P>
Musical themes in the Themefinder database are stored one theme to
a file.  The structure of the theme file is the standard Humdrum file
format with the first spine in the file being the thematic monophonic
music to be indexed for searching.  This musical data is in the **kern
musical representation.  Other spines may be present, such as lyrics,
neumatic notation, tone-row pitch classes, etc.  Currently these
additional spines are ignored by the thema command which indexes the
musical data for searching purposes.
</P>
<P>
The length of the theme should nominally be one line of output produced
in the generation of the muscial score in section II.B.2.  As a rule of
thumb, 30 notes fit well onto a single line.  Also, about 4 measures of
4/4 meter consisting mostly of eighth-notes fits well onto one line.
The primary reason for this guideline is to have an clean aesethic to
the search result display.  If the theme is longer than about 30 notes, 
then you can currently:
<ol>
<li>
not encode the rest of the theme.
<li>
place the rest of the theme in global comment records
</ol>
Another possibility would be to invent a tandem interpretation to
mark the end of the graphically displayed portion of the theme.
</P>
<P>
Here is an example theme encoded for Themefinder (Twinkle, Twinkle,
Little Star):
<TABLE>

</TABLE>
A complete themefile example can be found on the web, for example, at:
http://www.themefinder.org/cgi-bin/themeinfo?istn=168786577544&type=humdrum
</P>
<P>
The key signature in the example above, "*k[]",  contains no sharps or
flats, and the theme is in C-major according to the tandem interpretation
"*C:".  In order for scale degree searches to be done in themefinder,
you must include the key of the theme which is a tandem interpretation in
the form "*C:" where C is the tonic note of the key, and the case of the
key determines the mode: uppercase for major, and lowercase for minor.
Examples: "*F#:" = F-sharp major, "*a-:" = a-flat minor.
</P>
<P>
The time signature interpretation "*M4/4" is important for metrical
searches in themefinder.  The clef indication is important for the
graphical display of the notation.  Either treble or bass clefs are
preferred.  Only use other clefs such as alto clef if the music fits
much better on that clef.  Measure numbers can optionally be encoded
with the theme, but they are not used for searching or printing of the
theme in Themefinder.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the musical data, a theme file contains any type
of bibliographic records that are appropriate for the theme.
A list of standard Humdrum bibliographic records may be found at
http://dactyl.som.ohio-state.edu/Humdrum/guide.append1.html .  For the
above example, the title record would be:
<blockquote>
!!!OTL: Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star
</blockquote>
</P>
<P>
You can also specify the language used in the bibliographic record
by adding a two character ISO marker for the language (such as EN for
English, DE for german, ES for spanish, FR for french).  This language
encoding may be useful for future language display options in Themefinder,
but are currently not used:
<blockquote>
   !!!OTL@EN: Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star
</blockquote>
</P>
<P>
There is one bibliographic record which is required for application in
generating a short text entry for the theme in the search results pages:
<blockquote>
   !!!ref: 
</blockquote>
</P>
<P>
This record indicates what to display as identification for the theme on
the search results pages in Themefinder.  Shorthand substitution patterns
of the form @{XXX} are replaced with the contents of the bibliographic
record starting with the pattern !!!XXX: .  All other characters in the
!!!ref: record will become part of the final text string:
<blockquote>
!!!ref: <i>@{OTL}</i>
</blockquote>
</P>
<P>
For the above example theme, will become:
<blockquote>
<i>Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star</i>
</blockquote>
</P>
<P>
The <i>...</i> surrounding the title are the HTML codes for indicating
an italic font.
</P>

<H3>I.B. Theme file naming conventions.</H3>

<P>
Theme filenames within a collection being submitted should start with a
letter (a-z) and can be of any reasonable length.  The file name ends with
the extension ".thm".  Allowable characters include lowercase letters,
numbers, the dash (-) and underscore (_).
</P>
<P>
In Themefinder, theme files will be segregated according to the first
character of their filename, with up to 26 subdirectories dividing the
theme files into smaller units.  Ideally, there should be no more than
3,000 themes in any of these subdirectories.  The unix file system used
with Themefinder could perhaps reasonably hold up to 10,000 files in any
particular subdirectory.  If there are more theme files than 3,000 then
perhaps they should be renamed, or split into a second collection group.
Usually the name of the file indexes the themes in some manner, such as
with the Latin Motet collection:
</P>
<P>
    j15672312-01.thm

    j    = Initial from last name of composer
    1567 = RISM number 1567 for a particular year
    23   = RISM number 1567/23 for a particular edition
    12   = The 12th motet in the edition
    01   = first voice (top voice) of the motet
    .thm = File extension indicating that this is a Humdrum theme file.
</P>
<P>
For a theme collection, each theme must contain a unique filename.
Filenames between collections do not need to be unique.
</P>

<H3>I.C. Theme group files.</H3>

<P>
An important secondary data entry to provide to Themefinder is called
a theme group file.  This file describes the relation between themes
on several levels:
<ol>
<li>
<b>movement</b> -- themes which belong to the same movement.
<li>
<b>work</b> -- themes which belong to the same composition which may 
consist of several movements.
<li>
<b>collection</b> -- themes from compositions which are related in some way.
such as the same opus number, or same genre.
</ol>
</P>
<P>
The collection group, for example, may consist of:
<blockquote>
(a) J.S. Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier, Book I
<br>
(b) Vivaldi's Op.3 concertos
<br>
(c) Chopin's Preludes
</blockquote>
</P>
<P>
A general guideline for the size of a grouping is no more than 50 themes.
However, up to 100 themes in a group, particularly a collection group,
is reasonable.  Larger group sizes are unweldy and are not encouraged.
For example, all the themes in the symphonies of Haydn would be too large.
All the themes from Beethoven's symphonies are at about the limits of a
reasonable group size.  Note that the "collection" grouping is different
than a Themefinder "collection".
</P>
<P>
A theme grouping file contains all types of relations for all the
themes in a collection. To indicate a group one of the following three
characters are placed on the first column of the line:  "m", "w",
"c", followed by a colon, ":", followed by a tab charcter, followed by
a list of theme filenames, each separated by one space.  Below is an
example set of grouping entries for a three movement piece.  "file6"
is from the third movement.  Since there is only one theme in the third
movement, it does not have a movement-level entry in the groupings file.
But note that in the "work" level grouping "file6" is included.
</P>
<P>
m:	file1 file2 file3
<br>
m:	file4 file5 
<br>
w:	file1 file2 file3 file4 file5 file6
</P>
<P>
Notice that the filenames in the groupings file do not include the ".thm"
extensions.
</P>
<P>
In Themefinder, the theme grouping file data will be converted into
ISTN values and is used for several things:
<ol>
<li>
providing buttons [M], [W], and [C] for each theme that is 
a member of a larger grouping.  For example the opening theme
to Beethoven's 5th symphony has a hyperlink [M] that lists all
of the themes in the first movement, and [W] which lists all
themes in the 5th symphony.
<li>
Web hyperlinks can be associated with themes on various levels:
(a)theme, (b)movement, (c)work, (d)collection.  The grouping file
is the mechanism for making the maintenance of links common to
several themes simpler.
</ol>
</P>
<P>
It is possible to generate theme group files automatically if the 
themes are indexed in a systematic way.  For example, The Latin
Motet theme collection contains an incipit for each voice.  The
filenames of the Motet themes were organized such that each
composition had the same filename start, followed by a voice
indication:
</P>
<P>
<blockquote>
j15672312-01.thm        Soprano incipit
<br>
j15672312-02.thm        Alto incipit
<br>
j15672312-03.thm        Tenor incipit
<br>
j15672312-04.thm        Bass incipit
</blockquote>
</P>
<P>
which could be automatically processed into a theme grouping entry like so:
<blockquote>
w:	j15672312-01 j15672312-02 j15672312-03 j15672312-04
</blockquote>
</P>
<P>
Since automatic groupings of the themes are nearly impossible to
generate without errors, the theme groups file should be generated
by hand in most cases.
</P>

<H3>I.D. Image files.</H3>

<P>
Image files are preferrably generated in Themefinder with the Humdrum
Toolkit program "ms" which generates PostScript output which can then
be converted to GIF images for display in Themefinder.  This process
should be automatic, but often requires human intervention and
correction, Such as the theme of Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier Prelude
in C Major, book 1 -- where the notation of the theme is polyphonic.
</P>
<P>
For non-standard repertoires, you may have to generate your own graphical
notation for the themes.  For the Latin Motet collection, for example,
the "ms" command was not used; rather, a program was written to translate
the theme data into the MUP format directly, which was then used by the
mup program to convert the data into PostScript output.  The twelve-tone
collection was also a special case.
</P>

<H3>I.E. Conversion from other music data format into Humdrum.</H3>

<P>
Contact the Themefinder staff if you have a large set of musical themes
encoded in a method other than Humdrum **kern data.  Usually someone
can convert the data into Humdrum with an existing conversion program
or write a new conversion program.  Existing conversion programs in the
Humdrum Toolkit:
<blockquote>
(1) MuseData to kern program called muse2kern
<br>
(2) ESAC to kern
<br>
(3) Finale to kern?
</blockquote>
</P>
<P>
Other conversion tools available:
<blockquote>
(3) MUSTRAN to kern
<br>
(4) DARMS to kern -- this is a specialized converter which
converted the Latin Motet incipit collection into Humdrum.
</blockquote>
</P>
<P>
Converting from MIDI is problematic for many reasons including: 
chromatic accidental information is not recorded, measure lines
are usually not recorded, etc.
</P>
