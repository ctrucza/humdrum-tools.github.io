The <b>hum2fin</b> command provides the means to viewing humdrum files in the "Finale" 
graphical music notation editor by converting the Humdrum file into a Finale 
readable file. It takes a humdrum file as input and outputs a file with the 
same musical data represented in Finale's enigma transportable file format 
(.etf). The enigma format is an ASCII-based file format developed by CodaMusic 
Technology, developer of Finale, which allows finale data to be read by both 
Macs and PCs.
</P>
<P>
As of April 2000, <b>hum2fin</b> supports the following Humdrum data:
</P>
<P>
1. **kern representation
<b>hum2fin</b> supports most **kern signifiers, including:
</P>
<P>
0, 1, 2, 4, ... 128, '.', 
note duration
-, #
accdientals
a-g, A-g, r
pitches
' z ^ ; ~ , ` : W M S u v q
articulations and ornaments
J, L
beaming
[ ] -
tie
( )
slur
{ }
phrase
/, \\
stemming
* Supported kern signifiers
</P>
<P>
2. **dynam representation
<b>hum2fin</b> supports the following **dynam signifiers:

< > ( ) [ ]  X x r

<b>hum2fin</b> assumes that a **dynam spine is always specific to ONE **kern spine and 
it is always specific to the closest **kern spine to its right. Also, only ONE 
**dynam spine can be related to a **kern spine. The **dynam spine closest to 
the **kern spine gets the connection. For example, in the humdrum file below, 
</P>
<P>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD>**kern</TD><TD>**dynam</TD><TD>**dynam</TD><TD>**silbe</TD><TD>**kern</TD><TD>**kern</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>4r</TD><TD>f</TD><TD>p</TD><TD>I</TD><TD>4d</TD><TD>4f#</TD></TR>

</TABLE>
</P>
<P>
the **dynam spine with the piano marking is linked with the second **kern spine 
(fifth spine from the left). The **dynam spine containing the forte marking is 
ignored. Meanwhile, the **dynam spine (third spine from the left) is specific 
to the fifth spine from the left, but not the first spine nor the last one.	
</P>
<P>
3. **silbe representation
<b>hum2fin</b> can process the **silbe representation. 
Similar to the **dynam representation, <b>hum2fin</b> assumes that a **silbe spine is 
always specific to ONE **kern spine and it is always specific to the closest 
**kern spine to its right. Also, only ONE **silbe spine can be related to a 
kern spine. <b>hum2fin</b> assumes that the humdrum file adopts a through-composed 
humdrum format, so <b>hum2fin</b> does not recognize the *strophe tandem 
interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
4. Reference record
<b>hum2fin</b> reads the reference record !!!OTL and puts the text as the title of the 
music in the enigma file.
</P>
<P>
5. Humdrum's barline scheme
<b>hum2fin</b> recognizes and translates the following barline signifiers:
==|!, ==:!|, ==:|!, ==, =!, =", =-, =', = and = with measure number.
</P>
<P>
6. Spine paths
<b>hum2fin</b> only recognizes the exchange spine signifier *x. 
</P>
<P>
7. Tandem interpretations
<b>hum2fin</b> supports the following tandem interpretations: clefs, key signature, 
key, time signature, and instrument. 
</P>
<P>
Please note that <b>hum2fin</b> depends heavily on the **kern representation, which 
provides it with most of the essential musical data Finale needs.  Because 
Finale is unable to display notations such as slurs or dynamics alone without 
the actual notes themselves, there MUST be **kern spines in the Humdrum input 
file. All the non-kern spines should also be specific to particular **kern 
spines respectively. The linkage maybe suggested through the use of the tandem 
representaion *staff. For example, should <b>hum2fin</b> support the **harm 
representation in the future, the humdrum file
</P>

indicates that the **harm spine is related to the **kern spine to its left, but 
not the one to its right.
</P>
<P>
If no relationship is suggested, <b>hum2fin</b> assumes a relationship between the non-
kern spine and its closest kern spine to the right, as can be seen in the 
treatment of the **silbe and **dynam spines.
</P>
<P>
Recall that Humdrum representation are organized aas though the notated score 
has been rotated clockwise 90 degrees. This means that the upper-most part is 
typically represented by the right-most spine. <b>hum2fin</b> interprets the inputs 
according to this arrangement.
 </P>

<FONT color="0000FF"><H3>OPTIONS</H3></FONT>

-p (output unprocessed spines as textual underlay -not working)
</P>
<P>
<b>hum2fin</b> has the option of processing the non-supported spines as **silbe 
spines. This would enable users to view some spine's data as lyrics in Finale 
even if <b>hum2fin</b> has yet to support the spine's particular representation. To 
enable this option, append to the command line"-p".
</P>
<P>
Please be very aware of the way <b>hum2fin</b> process these non-supported spines when 
enabling this option. <b>hum2fin</b> will process the non-supported spine the same way 
as it processes the silbe spines. <b>hum2fin</b> will assume the non-supported spine 
to be related to some specific kern spine. Please read the "*silbe 
representation" part in the Description section for more details.

Duplets
<b>hum2fin</b> does not display duplets with the conventional    2    sign. It 
displays duplets as dotted notes instead.
</P>
<P>
Natural Sign
<b>hum2fin</b> recognizes the need of accidentals through the kern signifiers "-", 
"#", and "n". In the **kern representation, it is possible to have a note 
requiring an accidental but does not have the above signifiers. For example, in 
the key of F major, if the note is b natural, in Finale a natural sign is 
needed, but in **kern, only a "b" is needed to show that it is a b natural. In 
such a case, <b>hum2fin</b> will fail to recognize the "b" as a b-natural but treat it 
as a b-flat.
</P>
<P>
Measure 1 Label
<b>hum2fin</b> assumes the first measure in score is measure one and labels it as 
measure one (even if it is a pickup).
</P>
<P>
There are also limitations in how <b>hum2fin</b> process the **dynam and **silbe 
representations. Please refer to the corresponding parts in the Description 
section in this document.

<FONT color="0000FF"><H3>PORTABILITY</H3></FONT>

There are <b>hum2fin</b> versions both for unix/linux and MSDOS. 
</P>
<P>
<center><HR WIDTH=500></center>
<FONT color="0000FF"><H3>ERRORS</H3></FONT>
</P>
<P>
<b>hum2fin</b> has error messages when there are errors with reading input and output 
files. <b>hum2fin</b> also requires the files "barline.txt", "artic.txt", "dynam.txt" 
and "etfBegin.txt" for outputting the enigma file and if there are problems 
reading these files, error messages would be issued.
</P>
<P>
If the program unexpectedly aborts, without any warnings or error messages, 
please check to see if the humdrum input file complies with the format or 
restrictions specified in the descriptions section of this document.
</P>

<FONT color="0000FF"><H3>AUTHORSHIP</H3></FONT>
The original translation program was written by Robert Gjerdingen
in the awk programming language.
The program was re-written and extended by Po-yan Tsang in C++.
