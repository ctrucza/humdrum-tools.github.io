<FONT color="0000FF"><H3>DESCRIPTION</H3></FONT>
The <b>fin2hum</b> command provides the means for the user to process a Finale enigma 
file with Humdrum tools by converting the Finale file into a humdrum file. The 
<b>fin2hum</b> command accepts a Finale engima file as input and outputs a file with 
the same musical data represented in the humdrum format. The enigma format is 
an ASCII-based file format developed by CodaMusic Technology, developer of 
Finale, which allows finale data to be read by both Macs and PCs.
</P>
<P>
As of April 2000, <b>fin2hum</b> is able to convert Finale's musical data into the 
following Humdrum representations or interpretations:
</P>
<P>
1. **kern representation
<b>fin2hum</b> supports most kern signifiers, including:
</P>
<P>
0, 1, 2, 4, ... 128, '.', 
note duration
-, #
accdientals
a-g, A-g, r
pitches
' z ^ ; ~ , ` : W M S u v q
articulations and ornaments
J, L
beaming
[ ] -
tie
( )
slur
{ }
phrase
/, \\
stemming
* Supported kern signifiers
</P>
<P>
2. Humdrum's barline scheme
Hum2fin recognizes the following barline signifiers:
==|!, ==:!|, ==:|!, ==, =!, =", =-, =', = and = with measure number.
</P>
<P>
3. Tandem interpretations
Hum2fin supports the following tandem interpretations: clefs, key signature, 
key, time signature, and instrument. 
</P>
<P>
Recall that Humdrum representation are organized aas though the notated score 
has been rotated clockwise 90 degrees. This means that the upper-most part is 
typically represented by the right-most spine. The <b>fin2hum</b> command places the 
lowest Finale staff in the left-most spine, with subsequent staffs placed 
consecutively to the right.

<FONT color="0000FF"><H3>FILES</H3></FONT>
fin2hum (shell script), fin2hum.exe (compiled C++ executable), artic.txt, 
barline.txt, dynam.txt
</P>
<P>
(The fin2hum script is the main program. It first calls the fin2hum.exe 
program. The fin2hum.exe executable reads the enigma file and outputs temporary 
files that consist of one spine each. The fin2hum script then takes the 
temporary spine files and assembles them into one standard Humdrum file.)

<FONT color="0000FF"><H3>LIMITS</H3></FONT>
<b>fin2hum</b> adds natural signs according to standard orthographic rules, which is 
to place a natural sign for a note that had an accidental before in the SAME 
measure. However, in **kern, this rule does not apply.  **Kern expects a 
natural sign when the first note of the same pitch appears without an 
accidental, regardless of whether the two notes are in the same measure.

Linux, and MSDOS with MKSToolkit. The Humdrum Toolkit needs to be installed in 
the system also.

<FONT color="0000FF"><H3>ERRORS</H3></FONT>
Error reading files
<b>fin2hum</b> has error messages when there are errors with reading input and output 
files. <b>fin2hum</b> also requires the files "barline.txt", "artic.txt" for 
outputting the humdrum file; if there are problems reading these files, error 
messages are issued.
</P>
<P>
Errors with Timebase, Assemble commands
In the <b>fin2hum</b> script, the humdrum tools "timebase" and "assemble" are used.  
Therefore make sure that you have installed the Humdrum Toolkit in your system 
and also have the above tools installed.

<FONT color="0000FF"><H3>AUTHORSHIP</H3></FONT>
The original translation program was written by Robert Gjerdingen
in the awk programming language.
The program was re-written and extended by Po-yan Tsang in C++.
