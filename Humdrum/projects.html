<i>
<FONT SIZE=+2>S</FONT>ince its public release in 1993,
the Humdrum Toolkit has been adopted by musicologists pursuing a wide
variety of research interests.
Innumerable scholarly projects have relied on Humdrum,
and at least three dozen published articles have resulted.
Here are a few discoveries that scholars have been made using the
<b>Humdrum Toolkit</b>.

Denis Collins of Stanford University used the Humdrum Toolkit to compare
canonic compositional rules by Zarlino, Berardi, and Nanino.
Collins studied how well the canonic practice actually conforms to the
different theoretical prescriptions.
He found that, although Berardi's and Nanino's rules were extensions
to Zarlino's work, Zarlino's original rules provided more succinct
and more precise descriptions of the canonic repertoire.

Unjung from the University of Hawaii at Manoa used Humdrum to examine
scale systems in Korean court music.
Using a repertoire of recorded
<i>p'iri</i>
music, Nam was able to represent pitches both according to the traditional
Korean designations as well as using frequency and cents.
She used Humdrum to establish which works were performed in different
modes and which were performed using different tunings.

Matthew Royal of the University of Western Ontario used the Humdrum
Toolkit to investigate the relationship between melodic accent and
syllable/mellismatic text relationships in Gregorian chant.
He found evidence that the chant literature is <i>not</i>
organized in a way consistent with rhythmic or metric performance.

Berec of the University of Waterloo used Humdrum to investigate
idiomaticism in trumpet and cornet works written by virtuoso performers
and non-trumpet players.
Using a model of performance mechanics, Berec was able to identify
those works which are most idiomatic to the instrument.

Kornst&auml;dt of the University of Hamburg created a music analysis
application that allows musicologists and theorists to do
sophisticated "mark-up" of scores, such as Leitmotivic analysis
of Wagner operas.
A notable feature of <i>JRing</i> is the intuitive graphic
user interface which replicates an "analytic desktop".
Humdrum is used as the underlying analytic engine.

late Dr. Helmut Schaffrath of the University of Essen supervised the
encoding of thousands of European folksongs from ethnomusicological sources.
In 1995 Schaffrath's database was translated to the Humdrum format.
Averaging successive pitches in thousands of phrases revealled a
marked melodic arch shape.

Serafini of the University of Washington used the Humdrum Toolkit to
investigate the effect of tempo on the organization of Haydn string quartets.
She found evidence consistent with Daniel Berlyne's theory of
optimum complexity: as the tempo increases, rhythmic and harmonic
complexity is reduced.

Simpson of the Walt Disney `Imagineering' research center
has used the Humdrum Toolkit to create a two-dimensional
"musical texture map."
Simpson used a large database of existing works and showed how a
computer algorithm could be used to automatically classify the works
as predominantly monophonic, homophonic, or polyphonic in texture.

David Huron of the Ohio State University has used the Humdrum Toolkit
to investigate asymmetries in notated musical dynamics.
For the vast majority of composers, crescendos are more frequent
and last longer than dimineundos.
Of the composers studied, Beethoven is the composer with the
greatest dynamic asymmetry.
Carl Nielsen is the composer with the least dynamic asymmetry.

Mark Dewitt of the University of California, Berkeley is using the
Humdrum Toolkit to investigate how the melodic and harmonic organization
of Cajun music has been influenced by the button accordian.
Dewitt is able to encode his own accordian tablature
transcriptions directly into Humdrum.
