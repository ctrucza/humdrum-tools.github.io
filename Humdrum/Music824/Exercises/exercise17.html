<li>
It is commonly thought that melodies are organized with a preference
for small melodic intervals (the so-called "pitch-proximity principal").
It is possible that small intervals arise simply because of
limitations of range.
Most pitches occur in the central part of an instrument's or
voice's range, so even for random melodies most intervals ought to be small.
Using the Humdrum
<B>scramble</B> command compare the <I>average interval size</I>
for an actual melody with the <I>average interval size</I>
when the order of notes for the melody has been randomly rearranged.
(For this exercise use the French patriotic song
<I>Allons enfants de la patrie</I> [<code>france01.krn</code>]).

<li>
It is commonly thought that large intervals tend to be followed
by smaller intervals.
If small intervals are already very common, wouldn't we
expect to see many small intervals following large intervals by
chance?
For this question, use the <code>french08.krn</code> folksong
and assume that a "large" interval is 5 semitones or larger.
