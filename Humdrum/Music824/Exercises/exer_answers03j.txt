!! COMMENTARY:  The first four notes sound in the time of a half note.
!! If this consisted of three quarter triplets, each would have a
!! duration of 6 (2 x 3 = 6).  Hence the quarter notes here are
!! encoded as "6".  The two eighths should also sum to a 6th:
!! (2 x 6 = 12), hence the triplet eighths are encoded as "12".
!!
!! In the second half of the bar, we again have three "6" durations.
!! Consider the inner triplet first.  Since we have 3 in the time of
!! 6, they are encoded (3 x 6) as "18th" notes.
!!
!! Now consider the dotted eighth-sixteenth figures.  Once again
!! these add up to a total of 6.  The sixteenth represents
!! one-quarter of this total, hence the sixteenth is (6 x 4) - 24.
!! Something three times longer than a 24th is (24 divided by 3) - 8.
