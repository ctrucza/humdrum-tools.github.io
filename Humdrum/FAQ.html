<H2><FONT color="0000FF">1. What is Humdrum?</FONT></H2>
<P>
Humdrum is a set of general-purpose software tools intended to
assist music researchers in posing and answering research questions.
Humdrum allows researchers to encode, manipulate, and output a wide
variety of musically-pertinent representations.  The emphasis is on
posing and answering questions about music.
</P>
<P>
Humdrum is <b>not</b> (1) a MIDI sequencer, (2) a music printing package,
or (3) a computer sound synthesis language;
however, Humdrum provides tools that
allow limited MIDI, notation, and Csound connectivity.
</P>
<P>
Humdrum allows users to pose and answer questions such as the
following:

<ul>
  <li> In Stravinsky, are dissonances more common in strong metric positions
    than in weak metric positions?
  <li> Is there evidence of greater metric syncopation in later Gershwin
    than in early Gershwin?
  <li> What passages of the original `Salve Regina' antiphon are preserved
    in the settings by Tomas Luis de Victoria?
  <li> In Urdu folk songs, how common is the so-called "melodic arch" --
    where phrases tend to ascend and then descend in pitch?
  <li> Which of the Brandenburg Concertos contains the B-A-C-H motif?
  <li> What are the most common fret-board patterns in guitar riffs by
    Jimi Hendrix?
  <li> Which of two English translations of Schubert lyrics best
    preserves the vowel coloration of the original German?
  <li> After the V-I progression, which harmonic progression is most
    apt to employ a suspension?
  <li> In what harmonic contexts does H&#228ndel double the leading-tone?
  <li> Are crescendos in Wagner more strongly associated with rising
    pitch than is the case for other composers?
  <li> Which of several MIDI performances displays the greatest contrast
    in dynamics between the initial thematic statement and the
    thematic return?
</ul>

Only a few of the above questions are "easy" to answer using Humdrum.
Although the Humdrum tools may take just seconds to compute an answer
for a given problem, the primary impediment to quick solution is the
user's skill in interconnecting the right tools for the task at hand.
<A HREF="guide.toc.html">Detailed documentation</A>
(in both on-line and printed forms)
is available to help users develop fluency in using Humdrum.
</P>
<A NAME="Say_More">
<hr>

<H2><FONT color="0000FF">2. Can you say more?</FONT></H2>
<P>
"Humdrum" is actually two things:  (1) the <i>Humdrum Syntax</i> and
(2) the <i>Humdrum Toolkit</i>.
</P>
<P>
The <i>Humdrum Syntax</i> is a grammar for representing sequential symbolic
information using ASCII (text) data.  Note that "Humdrum" is not a representation
scheme in the conventional sense -- like DARMS.  Humdrum is a <i>syntax</i>
within which an endless number of representation schemes can be defined.
Theoretically, any type of sequential symbolic data may be accommodated --
such as square notation, Schenkerian graphs, piano fingerings, changes
of emotional states, MIDI data, acoustic spectra, North Indian tabla bols,
ballet steps, concurrent television schedules, or industrial
chemical processes.
</P>
<P>
The <i>Humdrum Toolkit</i> is a set of more than 60 inter-related
software tools.  These general-purpose tools manipulate ASCII (text) data
that conforms to the Humdrum Syntax.  If the ASCII data represent
music-related information, then we can say that the Humdrum Tools
manipulate music-related information.
<A HREF="commands.toc.html">On-line documentation</A>
is available describing each of the tools.
</P>
<A NAME="Do">
<hr>

<H2><FONT color="0000FF">3. What can Humdrum do?</FONT></H2>
<P>
Humdrum's capabilities are quite abstract, and so it is difficult
to characterize briefly what it can do.
</P>
<P>
Humdrum can encode information in various forms, such as French lute
tablatures, conducting gestures, or structural relationships.  It can
transform, classify, coordinate, transfer, restructure, contextualize,
and otherwise manipulate both pre-defined and user-defined information.
</P>
<P>
Humdrum can be used to search for a mind-boggling variety of types
of patterns.  For example, you can look for specific finger-fret
combinations (independent of the string, say) in a work for Indian
sitar.  Or you can look for particular patterns of open and closed
vowels in vocal lyrics that are associated with a certain melodic
contour, and are also anchored to a specified metrical context.
</P>
<P>
Humdrum is also able to characterize the similarity between
various types of information according to user-defined criteria of
similarity.
</P>
<P>
Humdrum's search and similarity commands are generalized software tools
that are independent of any given representation.  As a consequence,
these tools do not impose any pre-defined notions of what you might
want to search for, or what properties you wish to compare.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred
<A HREF="problems.html">concrete examples</A>
of Humdrum's capabilities are
described on-line.  In addition, several examples are given
later in this document.
</P>
<A NAME="Who_Benefit">
<hr>

<H2><FONT color="0000FF">4. Who will benefit from using Humdrum?</FONT></H2>
<P>
Humdrum will be of potential benefit to anyone wishing to pursue
systematic investigations of musical information.  This includes
the posing of "factual" questions about music, and the testing of
hypotheses about musical organization.
</P>
<P>
In short, Humdrum may prove valuable to music theorists, music analysts,
ethnomusicologists, historical musicologists, psychomusicologists, music
librarians, dance scholars, linguists, and people who have a general
interest in music.
</P>
<P>
Humdrum is less well suited to individuals involved in creative
(i.e. generative) musical activities -- such as composition, conducting,
or performance.  However, Humdrum is well suited to <i>studying</i>
compositions, conducting, performances ...
</P>
<A NAME="Systems">
<hr>

<H2><FONT color="0000FF">5. What computer systems does Humdrum run on?</FONT></H2>
<P>
Humdrum was designed for the UNIX operating system.  It runs on a variety
of UNIX systems including Linux, HPUX, NeXTSTEP, etc.  It also runs
under Windows '95, Windows '98, Windows NT, DOS and OS/2 -- provided basic
UNIX commands are available.  For example, Humdrum runs on Microsoft systems
that have installed either the `MKS Toolkit', or the Consensys Corporation
`Portage' utilities.
Humdrum has also been installed and used on Apple computer systems (see below).
</P>
<A NAME="Macintosh">
<hr>

<H2><FONT color="0000FF">6. Does Humdrum run on Macintosh systems?</FONT></H2>

<H3>Mac OS 8/9</H3>
<P>
Since Apple computer systems do not provide basic UNIX
utilities, the Humdrum Toolkit cannot be run on native Apple systems.
There are three ways to configure Apple hardware to run Humdrum.
The least disruptive way to install the Humdrum Toolkit is to
purchase a commercial set of UNIX utilities for Apple Systems.
<A HREF="http://www.tenon.com">
<B>Tenon Intersystems</B></A>
distributes a suitable product called
<A HREF="http://www.tenon.com/products/machten/">
<B>MachTEN.</B></A>
</P>

<P>
A
<A HREF="http://www.opus1.com/www/jms/machten.html">
<B>review of the MachTEN software</B></A>
(including a comparison with A/UX)
was published in <I>Advanced Systems Magazine</I>
(formerly <I>Sun World Magazine</I>).
</P>

<H3>Mac OS ></H3>
Since Mac OS X is a flavor of UNIX, the Humdrum tools run fine from the command line.

<H3>A/UX</H3>
<P>
Humdrum can also run under APPLE's A/UX system.
</P>

<H3>Linux MK kernal (MkLinux)</H3>
<P>
Another possibility is to install
the
<A HREF="http://www.mklinux.apple.com/"><b>Linux MK kernal (MkLinux)</b></A>
for Apple hardware.
</P>

<P>
These latter two approaches preclude running
standard Apple software on the machine.
For this reason, purchasing MachTEN is usually
considered the best solution for Apple users.

<A NAME="Version">
<hr>

<H2><FONT color="0000FF">9. What is the current version of Humdrum?</FONT></H2>
<P>
The current official distribution for Humdrum is Version 1.0.
<br>
<br>
Humdrum continues to be up-dated by adding options to some tools,
fixing bugs, and augmenting the Toolkit with new commands.
More recent versions exist -- up to Version 2.6,
however, these versions are not official distributions.
In order for a version to be designated "official," we test all
of the tools using extensive test suites on a wide variety
of hardware platforms, running different operating systems,
and using different compilers.
This is a time-consuming process and can be done only
when we have funds to hire a programmer for about a month.
<br>
<br>
When making modifications to Humdrum, we don't know whether
the modifications we have made are fully portable to other
systems.
Without full-scale testing of the software on a variety of platforms,
it is not a good idea to replace the former distributed version.
Hence the discrepancy between the "official" version and
more current versions.
Users are free to use later versions, but we are not
as confident that these later versions have the
same portability as version 1.0.

Yes.

About 15% of the code is written in C, another 15% in kornshell,
and about 2% using the LEX lexical parser and YACC compiler-compiler.
The bulk of the code is written in AWK (a fast prototyping language).
C is used for tools that have special I/O requirements and to accelerate
some computationally intensive tools.
</P>
<A NAME="Quarter_Note">
<hr>

<H2><FONT color="0000FF">17. How do you represent, say, a quarter-note in Humdrum?</FONT></H2>
<P>
The question is mal-formed.  Humdrum doesn't dictate how to
represent such things as a quarter-note.  Remember, that Humdrum
is a <i>syntax</i> within which representations can be defined.  Users
are free to use whatever string of ASCII characters they want in
order represent a quarter-note.  The only restriction is that the
representation must conform to the Humdrum Syntax.
</P>
<A NAME="Exchange_Data">
<hr>

<H2><FONT color="0000FF">18. If that's so, how do users exchange data?</FONT></H2>
<P>
Actually, there are a large number of pre-defined representations
each conforming to the Humdrum Syntax.  Users aren't required to
use these pre-existing representations, but they are generally
more convenient than starting from scratch.  Think of these predefined
representations as analogous to macro packages.
</P>
<P>
Each representation conforming to the Humdrum Syntax is given a
unique name, preceded by two asterisks.  For example, "**freq" is
a pre-defined representation used to represent frequency;
"**pcset" is a pre-defined representation used to represent
pitch-class sets;  "**cocho" is a pre-defined representation used
to represent basilar-membrance coordinates in the cochlea.  There
are lots of these pre-defined representations.
</P>
<P>
To answer the previous question: in the "**recip" representation,
quarter-notes are represented by the ASCII numeral "4" (the
reciprocal of the American duration names).  But remember,
HUMDRUM, does not require you to represent quarter-notes this
way.  Only the "**recip" representation requires this.  If you
prefer "crotchet" to "quarter note", Humdrum obliges.
</P>
<A NAME="Example">
<hr>

<H2><FONT color="0000FF">19. Can you show an example of how to encode a piece of music in Humdrum?</FONT></H2>
<P>
Still not catching on.  There are an infinite number of ways
of representing a piece in the Humdrum format -- it depends on
what sort of information the user is interested in.  Some users
will be interested in stem-direction and size of note-heads.
Other users will be interested in representing the valve-combinations
for the trumpet part.
</P>
<P>
For example, here is an encoding of a complete sonata-allegro
movement that conforms to the Humdrum syntax:
<blockquote>
<table>
<tr><td>**form</td></tr>
<tr><td>Introduction</td></tr>
<tr><td>Exposition</td></tr>
<tr><td>Development</td></tr>
<tr><td>Recapitulation</td></tr>
<tr><td>Coda</td></tr>
<tr><td>*-</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
Probably not what you had in mind.
</P>
<A NAME="Kern">
<hr>

<H2><FONT color="0000FF">20. Okay, how might you encode the pitch and duration for a piece of music?</FONT></H2>
<P>
Currently, the most commonly used Humdrum representation is
<A HREF="representations/kern.html">**kern.</A>
Kern is a core pitch/duration representation.  Below is a **kern
representation showing the beginning of "Happy Birthday."  In addition,
we've represented the lyrics as well:
<blockquote>

</TABLE>
</blockquote>
Note the following:  Time moves down the page.  Data are arranged
in columns (called "spines") beginning with a keyword (e.g. **kern)
indicating the type of representation.  Data are terminated by a
"spine-path terminator" (*-).  Each line represents concurrent
activities across all spines.  Spines are separated by tabs.  In the
case of **kern, durations are represented by the reciprocal numbers
of the American designations (4=quarter, 2=half; 8.=dotted-eighth).
Pitches are represented by letter names (a-g and A-G).  Lower-case
letters indicate pitches above (and including) middle C; upper-case
letters indicate pitches below middle C.  Letters are repeated (e.g.

Although not shown in the above example, **kern is also able to
represent rests, ties, phrases, slurs, keys, key signatures, meter
signatures, keys, accidentals, articulation marks, stem directions,
beaming, barlines, and ornaments.

Lines beginning with a double exclamation mark are "global comments"
and pertain to all spines.  ("Local comments" pertain to single
columns or spines.)  Following the "exclusive interpretation" (**kern),
several "tandem interpretations" specify the key-signature (*k[]), the
key (*a:), the meter signature (*M4/4), and the tempo (*MM72).  Barlines
are indicated by an equals-sign.  Rests are indicated by the lower-case
letter `r'.  Columns of data (spines) are separated by tabs.  In this
case, each spine represents a different musical part or voice.  Parts
are ordered from left-to right with the lowest voice in the left-hand
spine.  In the final chord, double-stops (two pitches) are evident in the
lower two voices.  When only one voice is active, the other voices encode
"null tokens" (.) as place holders.  The file is structured like a score
turned sideways.  Whole-tone trills are designated by the upper-case `T';
tied notes are designed by square brackets; pauses are indicated by the
semicolon.

<P>
Currently, there are a handful of software tools that translate from
various formats to Humdrum.  Music encoded in Leland Smith's SCORE
format can be translated to Humdrum using a program written by
Andreas Kornstaedt of the University of Hamburg.  Music encoded in
Helmut Schaffrath's ESAC representation (Essen Associative Code) can
also be translated to Humdrum.  Another program can translate Barry
Brook's Plaine and Easie Code (used by RILM) to Humdrum.

These translation tools are not currently distributed as part of
the Humdrum Toolkit.  They are available by special request.

Humdrum commands.
</P>
<A NAME="Processing">
<hr>

<H2><FONT color="0000FF">28. Can you provide some examples of Humdrum processes?</FONT></H2>
<P>
Here are some examples of simple Humdrum pipelines.
</P>
<P>
The following command extracts all woodwind parts from the
file "ives":
<blockquote>
<code><big>
     extract -i '*ICww' ives
</code></big>
</blockquote>
The following command identifies the frequency of light-related
words such as "lumen" or "lumine" in the different monastic offices
for Thomas of Canterbury:
<blockquote>
<code><big>
    extract -i '*Latin' office* | egrep -ic 'lum.+n[e]*$'
</code></big>
</blockquote>
The following command outputs the location of all sonorities in
the file "machaut" where the leading-tone has been doubled:
<blockquote>
<code><big>
     deg -x machaut | grep -n '7.*7'
</code></big>
</blockquote>
The following commands identify all phrase-endings in the file
"wagner" that are approached by a descending semitone:
<blockquote>
<code><big>
     semits -xt wagner | fill > temp
     <br>
     assemble wagner temp | grep -n '}.*-1[^0-9]'
</code></big>
</blockquote>
The following commands identify German, French, and Italian sixth chords.
<blockquote>
<code><big>
     solfa -x input | fill -s = | grep '.*6-.*4+' | grep '3-'    [German]
     <br>
     solfa -x input | fill -s = | grep '.*6-.*4+' | grep '2'     [French]
     <br>
     solfa -x input | fill -s = | grep '.*6-.*4+' | grep '[^23]' [Italian]
</code></big>
</blockquote>
A common musicological task is searching for various patterns.
The `patt' and `pattern' commands accept a user-specified
template file such as the following:
<blockquote>
<code><big>
     P5
     <br>
     P5
</code></big>
</blockquote>
Given the above two-line file ("template"), the following command will
identify all instances of parallel fifths between the bass and alto
parts for the file "caccini":
<blockquote>
<code><big>
     extract -i '*bass,*alto' caccini | hint -c | pattern -s = -f template
</code></big>
</blockquote>
Given the following three-line "template" file:
<blockquote>
     =
     <br>
     .*     +
     <br>
     sus
</code></big>
</blockquote>
 ... the following command outputs the measure numbers where
suspensions are found in the file "bwv552":
<blockquote>
<code><big>
     extract -i '**embel' bwv552 | patt -e -f template | grep '='
</code></big>
</blockquote>
The following command produces an inventory of all pitch-class
sets evident for successive vertical sonorities in the file "opus24".
In this case, only Z-related sets are requested in the inventory:
<blockquote>
<code><big>
     pc opus24 | fill -s = | pcset | grep 'Z' | sort | uniq
</code></big>
</blockquote>
The following script command finds all instances of 12-tone rows in
Webern's Opus 24:
<blockquote>
<code><big>
     matrix -n 12 prime
     <br>
     rowfind opus24
</code></big>
</blockquote>
The following command outputs the final two measures for all works
in the current directory; the output is played as a MIDI output.
<blockquote>
<code><big>
    yank -o ^= '$-1-$' * | midi | perform
</code></big>
</blockquote>
The above examples are mostly simple one-line invocations, and do not
begin to exhaust Humdrum's capabilities.

</P>
<A NAME="Searching">
<hr>

<H2><FONT color="0000FF">29. Can I search for a specific theme or motif?</FONT></H2>
<P>
Yes.  There are innumerable ways of defining a "theme" or "motif."
Typically, motives are thought of as pitch/duration patterns.
However, motivic instances typically appear at different pitch
heights, in transpositions, different modes, in augmentation, and so
on.  Hence, a motif might be better defined as an interval/duration
pattern, or as an interval/relative-duration pattern, or as a diatonic
interval pattern, a pitch-contour pattern, a metric pattern, etc.
Searching for any such patterns is trivial using Humdrum.  Most such
searches can be accomplished by executing a one-line shell-level command.
</P>
<P>
Humdrum also allows the user to constrain pattern searches by looking
for combinations of information.  For example, the user might seek
only those pitch patterns that exhibit certain sequences of articulation
marks, are anchored in some specified way to a phrase boundary, and/or
are accompanied by certain harmonies.
</P>
<P>
Pattern searches need not be melodically oriented (horizontal search).
Searches can also be vertical, or even diagonal (e.g. a Klangfarbenmelodie
-- a melody that traverses between several instruments).  Patterns may also
be combinations of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal.  For example, find
all instances of a lowered seventh based a subdominant root approaching
a V chord, when the oboe and bassoon are playing, but not at the beginning
of a phrase.
</P>
<P>
In addition to exact pattern matches, Humdrum provides tools that
allow matches with passages that are <i>similar</i> but not identical to
the sought pattern.  Patterns can be sought in which embellishments
have been added to specified structural elements.  Patterns of patterns,
and patterns of patterns of patterns can be studied.
</P>
<A NAME="MIDI">
<hr>

<H2><FONT color="0000FF">30. Does Humdrum import/export MIDI?</FONT></H2>
<P>
Yes.  Humdrum can important MIDI data via the `record' and `encode'
commands.  `Record' allows the recording of raw MIDI data in the
Humdrum format.  `Encode' permits the user to map real-time MIDI
activity to any user-defined Humdrum representation.
</P>
<P>
Humdrum can export MIDI data via the `smf' and `perform' commands.  `smf'
is used to generate Standard Midi Files which can be imported to other
applications software -- such as MIDI sequencers or notation packages.
The `perform' command plays Humdrum-format MIDI information in real-time.
</P>
<P>
In order to use the Humdrum MIDI capabilities, you must have access
to an MPU-401 compatible MIDI card.  Currently, the Humdrum MIDI
tools only work under DOS, Windows 95/98/NT, and Linux..

Although Humdrum might be used in high-level aspects of composition,
Humdrum is not well suited to very low-level acoustical (sound-function)
manipulations common in electroacoustic music.

A general graphic user interface for Humdrum has been developed by
Michael Taylor of Queen's University, Belfast.  The Taylor interface

<H2><FONT color="0000FF">35. Is Humdrum easy to use?</FONT></H2>
<P>
Humdrum is rooted in the UNIX "software tools" design philosophy.
That is, each tool in the toolkit carries out a simple operation.
However, by interconnecting the tools, the capacity for music
processing is legion.  In essence, assembling Humdrum command lines
amounts to a form of computer programming.  Learning Humdrum is
comparable in complexity to learning a programming language such
as pascal or C.
</P>
<P>
Users who understand the concept of a UNIX pipeline, will readily
grasp how Humdrum works.  Users who are familiar only with menu-driven
software will find Humdrum takes some time to learn.
An
<A HREF="http://csml.som.ohio-state.edu/Music824/music824.html">
on-line course</A>
is available to learn Humdrum.
</P>
<P>
The graphic user interface developed by Michael Taylor considerably
simplifies the use of Humdrum -- especially for inexperienced
users.  Graphical approaches clearly hold much promise, especially
if the generality of Humdrum remains accessible.
</P>
<P>
Another graphical approach has been pioneered by Andreas Kornstaedt.
Kornstaedt has suggested that the Humdrum be used as the analytic
engine for task-specific applications that are designed for use by
ordinary musicologists.  For example, Kornstaedt has developed a
graphical environment ("Ring") for doing Leitmovic analysis of Wagner
operas.  The user interacts only with a graphical environment tailored
to particular kinds of tasks.  Although this approach does not allow
access to Humdrum's full capabilities, it may be of greater appeal
to music scholars with little programming experience.

<A NAME="Why">
<hr>

<H2><FONT color="0000FF">36. Why should I consider using Humdrum?</FONT></H2>
<P>
The principal reasons for using computers in music scholarship
are the following:
<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li> the computer increases your scholarly productivity,
  <li> the computer lets you address problems that are otherwise
      impossible to pursue.
  </ol>
</blockquote>
Not every musicologist will benefit from using Humdrum.
It depends on the types of tasks in which the user is interested.

<A NAME="UNIX">
<hr>

<H2><FONT color="0000FF">37. I am a PC user who has had no experience with UNIX.</FONT></H2>
    How should I go about learning to use Humdrum?
<P>
Understanding UNIX is an essential pre-requisite to the lucid use
of Humdrum.  If you do not have access to a UNIX system, you can
purchase a set of commercial UNIX utilities that will operate on
your PC.  The recommended utilities are available in the
"MKS Toolkit" -- which you can purchase in most university computer
stores.  (In the case of Windows NT, Humdrum should also work under
Consensys Corporation's "Portage".)
</P>
<P>
The essential foundation for using Humdrum includes:
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li> knowledge of how to use a text editor -- such as "vi" or "emacs"
<li> knowledge of how to define and manipulate "regular expressions"
    (a standard UNIX syntax for defining patterns)

Wordprocessors can be used in lieu of an editor, provided ASCII
text is handled properly.  Many wordprocessors treat carriage
returns and tabs in irregular ways -- although most wordprocessors
allow the user to override these defaults.  For example, Microsoft
Word can be used provided you invoke the "save as text file" option.
</P>
<P>
Note that Microsoft "edit" (comes with DOS) is unsuitable for
Humdrum since it insists on replacing ASCII tabs by spaces.
