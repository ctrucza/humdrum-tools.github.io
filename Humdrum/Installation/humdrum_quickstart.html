<h1>
Humdrum Quick-Start Tutorial</h1></center>

<h2>

<hr></h2>
Having installed the Humdrum Toolkit,
you will be eager to see Humdrum in action.
Begin by changing directories to the Humdrum demonstration directory.
This is located in the subdirectory
<i>demo</i> under the directory where
you installed Humdrum.
In most cases, you can change directories by typing the command:
<blockquote><tt>cd /humdrum/demo</tt></blockquote>
This directory holds a number of tutorial files, and also includes a subdirectory
containing a selection of musical scores encoded in various Humdrum formats.
<p>Begin by typing:
<blockquote><tt>demo</tt></blockquote>
This demonstration will first ask you whether you have an appropriate MIDI
set-up. Answer `yes' only if your system runs Windows 95/98/NT, DOS or
OS/2 and has a Roland MPU-401-compatible MIDI card with a MIDI synthesizer
connected for sound output. (Answering `no' will restrict the demonstration
to outputs that don't involve sound.)
<p>The Humdrum <tt>demo</tt> will provide a menu of
ten sample problems. Each problem will pose and answer some analytic question
in real-time. (On older machines, some of the sample calculations may take
several minutes to execute.) You can stop the demo at any time by typing
one or more control-Cs.
<p>If your system is configured for MIDI output, you might also try changing
directories to the <tt>scores</tt> subdirectory and
playing one of the scores. A MIDI version of the first movement of Haydn's
string quartet Opus 76, No. 3, is encoded in the file <tt>haydn76.hmd</tt>.

<p>Begin by typing the command:
<blockquote><tt>
<A HREF="../commands/perform.html">perform</a>
misc/haydn76.hmd</tt></blockquote>
If your MIDI system is properly configured,
you should hear a deadpan performance
of the work.
Try typing various numbers followed by&nbsp;<enter>.
This will move the performance immediately to the
corresponding numbered measure.
(If you enter a number greater than the total number of measures, playback
will terminate.) Type plus (+) or minus (-) to move ahead or backward one
measure at a time. Press the space-bar to interrupt play. Also try typing
`&lt;' and `>' to slow-down or speed-up the tempo. (Notice that you don't
have to use the shift-key when typing `&lt;', `>' or `+'.) You might also
want to explore the search commands. Try typing a slash (/) followed by
the word `Development', followed by&nbsp;<enter>. To search backward from
the current score position, use the question mark (?) rather than the slash
-- as in `?Exposition'&nbsp;<enter>. To end, type the escape key&nbsp;<ESC>.
If your MIDI instrument continues to sound after the
<b><A HREF="../commands/perform.html">perform</a></b>
program has ended, type:
<blockquote><b><tt>
<A HREF="../commands/tacet.html">tacet</a></tt></b></blockquote>
This will turn-off any sounding tones.
<p>You may want to view the accompanying videocassette in order to further
familiarize yourself with the capabilities of the Humdrum Toolkit. Ultimately,
you will need to begin reading the Humdrum
<i>Users' Guide</i> and start
working through the tutorial exercises. As with the study of a musical
instrument, practice is essential to developing a skill.

<h2>
How HUMDRUM Works</h2>
Some users may be interested in gaining a basic understanding how the Humdrum
tools work. The following description provides a general outline of the
operation of the Humdrum tools.
<p>The Humdrum tools were developed with several criteria in mind. The
foremost criterion was that the tools needed to be easy to program. Most
of the tools are written in the AWK programming language -- a "fast prototyping
language" whose syntax is very similar to that of the C programming language.
AWK was developed by Alfred Aho, Brian Kernighan, and Peter Weinberger
(hence the name AWK). AWK is especially well suited to musical applications
since AWK provides extensive, yet simple-to-use facilities for matching
and manipulating strings patterns.
<p>Since AWK is an interpreted language, AWK programs must invoke the AWK
interpreter each time they are executed. The command-line syntax for invoking
AWK programs is cumbersome. In order to simplify the command-line syntax,
special-purpose "shell scripts" have been used to massage the command invocation,
to parse the options, and to provide help screens where appropriate.
<p>Most Humdrum commands cause a shell-script to be executed. Each script
invokes the AWK interpreter and calls the appropriate AWK program. The
shell-scripts were written in the well-known UNIX
<i>Kornshell.</i> On
Windows 95/98/NT, DOS and OS/2 these scripts are held in files designated
by the
<i>.ksh</i> extension. These scripts can also be executed from the
<i>Bourne</i>
shell, but they are not compatible with the UNIX
<i>C</i> shell.
<p>A typical Humdrum command, such as the
<b><A HREF="../commands/kern.html">kern</a></b>
command, is associated with two files:
<i>kern.ksh</i> (or just
<i>kern</i>
on UNIX) and
<i>kern.awk.</i> The <tt>.awk</tt> script
acts as both the "source" code and the "executable" code. Both<tt>
.ksh</tt> and <tt>.awk</tt> files are ordinary
ASCII files, and so can be examined and (potentially) modified by the user.
<p>Some more complicated Humdrum commands have been partitioned into several
subprograms.
For example, the Humdrum
<b><A HREF="../commands/extract.html">extract</a></b>
command consists of four separate programs,
<i>extract1.awk, extract2.awk,</i>
and so on. The associated shell script
<i>(extract.ksh)</i> determines
which of the
<b>extract</b> programs should be invoked, on the basis of
the user-selected options.
<p>More computationally intensive programs have been written in the C programming
language. These include Humdrum commands such as
<b><A HREF="../commands/perform.html">perform</a></b>
and
<b><A HREF="../commands/simil.html">simil.</a></b> On Windows 95/98/NT,
DOS, the <tt>perform.exe, simil.exe,</tt> ... files
are executable files, compiled from C programs. The Humdrum distribution
disks include the complete source code (.c files) for all of these commands.
<p>In order to be able to execute Humdrum commands, several conditions
need to be satisfied. First, either the
<i>Kornshell</i> or
<i>Bourne</i>
shell command interpreter must be available. Second, the <i>AWK</i> language
interpreter must be available. Third, four pieces of information must be
accessible to the shell: (1) the shell must know where to find the Humdrum
commands, (2) it must know where to find the AWK interpreter, (3) it must
know where it can store temporary files, and (4) it must be told where
to direct standard error outputs (on UNIX normally <tt>/dev/tty</tt>;
on Windows 95/98/NT, DOS this is <tt>con</tt>. Each
of these four pieces of information need to be stored in shell "environment"
variables. The variables are named PATH, AWK_VER, TMP, and CON.
<p>When you boot your system, these variables need to be assigned properly,
otherwise the installed Humdrum tools will fail to work.
