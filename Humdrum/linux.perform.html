<H2>How to Use the "perform" Command in Linux</H2>
<P>
These directions are intended to help users install and use
the revised Humdrum "perform" version 2.0 command.
These directions are for Red Hat 6.0 Linux, although they may be
somewhat similar for other versions of Linux.

<li>
Install the soundcard.
You will have to check the list in Appendix A to see if the
soundcard you have will work in Red Hat Linux 6.0.
<br>
<br>
To install the soundcard, first turn off the computer and put
the soundcard into one of the expansion slots of the computer.
<br>
<br>
Now start the computer under Linux, and run the program
/usr/sbin/sndconfig as root.
<br>
<br>
If you have a recognized PCI interfaced soundcard, the installation 
should be completely automatic.  If you have an ISA interfaced 
soundcard, the you will have to manually set the IRQs, DMAs, and
I/O Ports.  You can figure out these manual settings in two 
ways: (1) log into Windows 95/98/NT, go to the control panel
system icon and click on the devices tab. Then go to the Multimedia
entries and search for the soundcard entry.  Double click on the 
soundcard entry and then select the resources tab.  On the resources
page, the IRQs, DMAs, and I/O Ports which are used for the
the soundcard are listed: copy these settings and try them in 
/usr/sbin/sndconfig. Manual setting method (2) is: try all possible
permutations of the settings for the soundcard until one of them
works.  The /usr/sbin/sndconfig program will play an audio file
and a MIDI file to test the sound configuration.  It is also possible
to mix methods (1) and (2) together for manually setting the soundcard.
<br>
<br>

<li>
Running the perform command.  
<br>
<br>
The perform command understands **MIDI humdrum spines in input
files.  **MIDI spines can be generated from **kern data with
the "midi" humdrum tool.  See note 3A below however.
<br>
<br>
Here are some important setup options for the perform command:
<br>
<br>
"perform -l" lists all possible MIDI output ports.  By default
MIDI information will be sent out port 0 unless otherwise specified
with the "perform -p X" option where X is another port number.  For
example on the CCARH lab computer, there are three possible 
MIDI output ports to send MIDI to:
<blockquote>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD>0:</TD><TD>Sound Blaster 16 (MIDI Out)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>1:</TD><TD>AWE Midi Emu (MIDI Out)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>2:</TD><TD>AWE32-0.4.3 (RAM4096k) (Wavetable)</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</blockquote>
There are two MIDI output ports (0 and 1) and one internal MIDI output
port which sends the MIDI to the internale soundcard synthesizer, so
to play MIDI output through port 1, you would use the option setting
"perform -p1".  See note 3C however.
<br>
<br>

   Other interesting arguments to the perform command:
<br>
<br>

   "perform -t X" sets the tempo scaling to X, for example to play
   a file twice as fast, try "perform -t 2.0".  The "<" and ">"
   keys can be used to control the tempo while the performance
   is occurring.
<br>
<br>

   "perform --memory 1000000" sets the storage area to 1 Mb.  This
    is the default size of the memory.  Large orchestral works will
    need more memory, such as 8000000.  In the newest (and as yet
    unfinished version of perform), there will be no need of this option.
<br>
<br>

   "perform --options" will list all command line arguments, including
    hidden/undocumented options if present.
<br>
<br>

   "perform -h" will give a short help message on using the perform command.
<br>
<br>

   The options to perform can occur in any order.  For example if you
   are performing the file zzz.hmd, then both of these calls to 
   perform are valid and equivalent:
      perform -t2 zzz.hmd
      perform zzz.hmd -t2
<br>
<br>

   Most command-line options have aliases.  The default velocity
   setting can be accessed with either "-v" or "--velocity":
      perform -v 64 zzz.hmd
      perform --velocity 64 zzz.hmd
   The "perform --options" will list all options aliases.
<br>
<br>


<li>
Known bugs/quirks in the perform command for Linux.  
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>
The perform command cannot be used in a command pipeline.
There is some strange terminal setting problem that needs
to be worked with to get this working.  Currently you must
write an intermediate file with the "midi" humdrum tool
and then run the "perform" command as a separate
<li>
Not all of the performance commands have been implemented.
<li>
On the internal MIDI in the soundcard at CCARH, only a 
monophonic voice is played at any given time.  So if you
are playing a symphony, you only hear one part.  This seems
to be a problem with the Linux driver for the soundcard.
The external MIDI port output of perform works properly
in the CCARH lab.
<li>
If you have a very large file to perform you may have to 
increase the memory size of the internal storage space if
directed to do so by an error message.  Use perform with
the --memory X option where X is the number of bytes to
store the data in.  The default setting is 1000000 bytes.

<H2>Appendix A: Soundcards that can be used in Red Hat Linux 6.0:</H2>

Here is a list of the soundcards that work with Linux Red Hat 6.0.
This list was extracted from the binary program /usr/sbin/sndconfig
which is the program to use to install a soundcard in Red Hat 6.0
Linux.
