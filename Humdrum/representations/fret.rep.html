<b>**fret</b>  --  generalized fretted tablature representation
</blockquote>
</P>

<FONT color="DD00FF"><H3>DESCRIPTION</H3></FONT>
<blockquote>
The
<b>**fret</b>
representation provides a comprehensive system for representing
performance aspects for fretted instruments.
The
<b>**fret</b>
scheme is suitable for representing tablature information for
most fretted instruments, including: common 6-string and 12-string guitars,
the 4-string bass guitar, lute, mandore, theorbo, chitarrone,
mandoline, banjo, dulcimer, and viols.
The
<b>**fret</b>
interpretation is not limited to equal-temperament tuning,
and so can be used to represent non-Western fretted instruments,
such as the oud and the sitar.
</P>
<P>
The
<b>**fret</b>
representation is performance-oriented rather than notationally-oriented.
Thus
<b>**fret</b>
is not suitable for distinguishing different visual renderings --
such as traditional French or German lute tablatures.
Special-purpose Humdrum representations should be used if the user's
goal is to distinguish different forms of visual signifiers.
</P>
<P>
The
<b>**fret</b>
representation distinguishes three types of data tokens:
tablature-tokens, rests, and barlines.
In addition,
<b>**fret</b>
provides three special-purpose tandem interpretations to
specify more precisely the instrument's layout and tuning.
</P>
<P>
The basic pitches produced by fretted instruments depend on three factors:
(1) the relative tuning of the strings with respect to each other,
(2) the absolute overall tuning of the instrument,
and (3) the position of the frets.
Three tandem interpretations allow the user to specify each of
these aspects:
<code><big>
*AT:
</code></big>
(absolute tuning),
<code><big>
*RT:
</code></big>
(relative tuning), and
<code><big>
*FT:
</code></big>
(fret tuning).
The absolute tuning and fret tuning have default settings,&#167
(&#167
The default absolute tuning is E2;
the default fret tuning is one semitone for each successive fret.)
however, the relative tuning of the open strings (<code><big>*RT:</big></code>)
must be explicitly encoded in a
<b>**fret</b>
spine.
</P>
<P>
The absolute tuning of an instrument is indicated by encoding
the pitch of the lowest string using the <code><big>*AT:</big></code> tandem interpretation.
For the common six-string guitar, the lowest pitch is normally tuned
to E2, and so would be encoded with the tandem interpretation:
<code><big>
</P>
<P>
<blockquote>
*AT:E2
</blockquote>
</P>
<P>
</code></big>
The <code><big>*AT:</code></big> interpretation makes use of
<A HREF="pitch.rep.html"><b>**pitch</b></A>-type
pitch designations and may also include cents deviation.
For example, an instrument tuned 45 cents sharp might be represented as
<code><big>
*AT:E2+45.
</code></big>
Encoding the absolute tuning of an instrument is optional in the
<b>**fret</b>
representation.
</P>
<P>
The tandem interpretation (<code><big>*RT:</big></code>) specifies the relative
tuning, number, and arrangement of strings.
Some instruments pair strings together in close physical proximity
so that two strings are treated by the performer as a single
virtual "string."
Such paired strings are referred to as
<i>courses.</i>
For example, the 12-string guitar is constructed using 6 courses,
and is played much like a 6-string guitar -- except that two strings
sound together, rather than a single string.
</P>
<P>
The <code><big>*RT:</big></code> tandem interpretation encodes the relative
tuning of each string by specifying the number of semitones
above the lowest string -- where each course is delineated by a colon (:).
In the following encoding,
the relative tuning of successive strings is 0, 5, 10, 15, 19, and
24 semitones above the lowest string.
This tuning defines the most common relative tuning for the six-string
guitar -- where successive strings are tuned above the lowest string
by a perfect fourth (5 semitones),
a minor seventh (10 semitones), a minor tenth (15 semitones),
a perfect fifteenth (19 semitones), and a double octave (24 semitones).
<code><big>
</P>
<P>
<blockquote>
*RT:0:5:10:15:19:24
</blockquote>
</P>
<P>
</code></big>
For non-Western and other instruments, it is possible to encode non-integer
semitone values for various strings, such as a string tuned 9.91 semitones
above the lowest string.
</P>
<P>
When courses consist of more than one string, the relative tuning
of each string in the course may differ.
When encoding the relative tuning,
each string within a course is separated by a comma (,)
in the relative tuning interpretation.
For example, a 12-string guitar is typically tuned as follows:
<code><big>
</P>
<P>
<blockquote>
*AT:E2
<br>
*RT:0,12:5,17:10,22:15,27:19,19:24,24
</blockquote>
</P>
<P>
</code></big>
In this case, the lower four courses consists of two strings tuned an
octave apart, whereas the upper two courses consist of paired unison strings.
</P>
<P>
Historically, the 6-course
<i>lute</i>
was tuned in a variety of ways -- the most common being the so-called
<i>vieil accord</i>
tuning: G2, C3, F3, A3, D4, and G4.
From low-to-high, the courses are named bass,
tenor, counter-tenor, great mean, small mean, and treble.
During the first half of the 16th century, it was common
to tune the lower three courses (bass, tenor, counter-tenor) in octaves.
Hence, the relative tuning may be represented as follows:
<code><big>
</P>
<P>
<blockquote>
*AT:G2
<br>
*RT:0,12:5,17:10,22:14,14:19,19:24,24
</blockquote>
</P>
<P>
</code></big>
Of course the absolute tuning of the lute was highly variable,
so the lowest pitch would not necessarily be G2.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the absolute and relative tunings,
<b>**fret</b>
also allows the user to specify the tuning of successive frets.
In Western instruments, frets are normally placed in semitone increments.
For a 12-fret instrument, this semitone arrangement may be explicitly
represented using the following tandem interpretation:
<code><big>
</P>
<P>
<blockquote>
*FT:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12
</blockquote>
</P>
<P>
</code></big>
Each successive numerical value indicates the number of semitones
above the open string for successive fret positions.
The interpretation begins with the tuning of the first fret
rather than the tuning of the open string.
The above interpretation is similar to the
<i>default fret tuning</i>
--  which is an increase of precisely one-- itone for each successive fret.
However, the above interpretation specifies only 12 frets, and so
fret positions higher than 12 would be considered errors in the above
encoding.
An instrument constructed with 1/4-tone fret positions can be encoded
as follows:
<code><big>
</P>
<P>
<blockquote>
*FT:.5,1,1.5,2,2.5,3,3.5,4,4.5
</blockquote>
</P>
<P>
</code></big>
The only restriction imposed by <code><big>*FT:</big></code> is that all strings must have
identical fret distances.
That is, if the first fret is positioned 1 semitone above the open
string, then this relative pitch arrangement must be true of all strings.
</P>
<P>
<i>Tablature-tokens</i>
encode information regarding the fret/finger positions,
the manner by which individual strings are plucked (or bowed),
pitch-bending, vibrato, damping, harmonics, and other effects.
The actions of individual fingers can also be represented.
Each tablature-token consists of a several subtokens in the
form of Humdrum multiple-stops.
Subtokens are delimited by spaces and represent individual courses/strings.
A six-string (or six-course) instrument will require six subtokens
in each tablature-token.
</P>
<P>
Subtokens consist of up to five component elements:
(1) the string/course status, (2) fret position,
(3) bowing/strumming, (4) finger action, and (5) percussive effects.
In addition, the tablature-token can encode bowing and strumming information.
</P>
<P>
In the
<b>**fret</b>
representation, the status of a string/course can occupy one of sixteen states:
(1) inactive, (2) plucked, (3) plucked ponticello, (4) plucked sul tasto,
(5) plucked tremolo, (6) pizzicato, (7) bowed, (8) bowed ponticello,
(9) bowed sul tasto, (10) spiccato, (11) col legno, (12) bowed tremolo,
(13) natural harmonic, (14) artificial harmonic,
(15) ringing, or (16) damped.
</P>
<P>
An
<i>inactive</i>
string is signified by the minus sign (-).
An ordinary
<i>plucked</i>
string is represented by the vertical line (|).
Plucking near the bridge (<i>plucked ponticello</i>) is represented by
the slash character (/).
Plucking near the tone-hole (<i>plucked sul tasto</i>) is represented by
the back-slash character (\).
The repeated
<i>plucked-tremolo</i>
(commonly used on the mandoline) is
represented using the octothorpe or hash character (#).
<i>Pizzicato</i>
is represented by the small letter `z'.
Normal bowing of a string is represented by the plus sign (+);
<i>ponticello</i>
bowing is represented by the open parenthesis `(' whereas
<i>sul tasto</i>
bowing is represented by the closed parenthesis `)'.
<i>Spiccato</i>
(bouncing the bow) is represented by the open curly brace `{'.
<i>Col legno</i>
(using the wood of the bow) is represented by the closed
curly brace '}'.
<i>Tremolo bowing</i>
is represented by the ampersand (&).
<i>Natural harmonics</i>
and
<i>artificial harmonics</i>
are represented by the lower-case `o' and upper-case `O' respectively.
String
<i>ringing</i>
is denoted by the colon (:), and the
<i>damping</i>
of a string is denoted by the small letter `x'.
</P>
<P>
By way of illustration, the following tablature-token represents
a six-string/course instrument, where the first through sixth
strings are respectively (1 and 2) plucked, (3) damped, (4) bowed,
(5) plucked sul tasto, (6) inactive.
<code><big>
</P>
<P>
<blockquote>
| | x + \ -
</blockquote>
</P>
<P>
</code></big>
Note that the layout of the strings in a tablature-token always
corresponds to the tuning specified in the relative-tuning interpretation.
In most representations, the lower-pitched strings will be
toward the left side of the tablature token.
</P>
<P>
<i>Bowing-direction</i>
and
<i>strumming</i>
information is prepended to the beginning of the tablature-token.
The direction of bowing/strumming is encoded using the left
and right angle brackets:
<code><big>
>
</code></big>
means to bow/strum from the strings on the left side of the
representation toward the strings on the right side of the representation.
On most instruments this means strumming
"downward" -- from the lowest- to the highest-pitched strings.
The left angle bracket:
<code><big>
<
</code></big>
means to strum in the opposite direction.
A rough indication of the speed of bowing/strumming can be
represented by duplicating these signifiers.
For example,
<code><big>
>>
</code></big>
means a slower "downward" bow/strum, and
<code><big>
<<<
</code></big>
means an especially slow "upward" bow/strum.
The percent sign (%) is used to signify the so-called
<i>rasgeado</i>
--  or flamboyant Spanish strum.
Once again these signifiers appear at the beginning of a tablature-token
--  whenever they are encoded.
Strumming all 6 open strings downward on a commonly-tuned guitar
is represented as:
<code><big>
</P>
<P>
<blockquote>
*AT:E2
<br>
*RT:0:5:10:15:19:24
<br>
>| | | | | |
</blockquote>
</P>
<P>
</code></big>
Notice that there is no space between the right angle bracket and
the first vertical bar.
</P>
<P>
<i>Fret-position</i>
information is indicated through the use of numbers,
with the first fret signified by the number `1'.
Fret-position numbers are encoded immediately to the right of their
respective string/course.
For example, the following tablature-token encodes a six-string/course
instrument in which the second and third strings are both stopped at the
second fret.
<code><big>
</P>
<P>
<blockquote>
>| |2 |2 | | |
</blockquote>
</code></big>
</P>
<P>
The
<b>**fret</b>
representation also permits the optional encoding of
<i>fingering</i>
information.
For the plucking-hand (normally right hand),
traditional musical abbreviations are used:
<i>P</i> (pollex) for the thumb, <i>I</i> (index) for the index finger,
<i>M</i> (medius) for the middle finger, <i>A</i> (annularis)
for the ring finger, and <i>Q</i> (quintus) for the little finger.
In addition, the lower-case letter <i>p</i> is used to signify
the palm of the hand.
Note that these letters are applied only to the `plucking' hand.
In the case of the `fret-board' hand,
the lower-case letters
<i>a-e</i>
are used to denote the thumb, index finger,
middle finger, ring finger, and little fingers, respectively.
Like the fret information, fingering information is encoded
immediately to the right of the string to which the information applies.
By way of illustration, the finger actions used in the above example
may be made explicit as follows:
<code><big>
</P>
<P>
<blockquote>
>|P |2bP |2cP |P |P |P
</blockquote>
</P>
<P>
</code></big>
The strum is carried out by the thumb, while the index and middle
fingers of the fret-hand stop the second and third courses/strings
at the second fret.
In the following continuation of this representation,
the first course/string is replucked by the thumb.
With the exception of the second and third courses/strings,
the other strings are allows to ring.
<code><big>
</P>
<P>
<blockquote>
>|P |2bP |2cP |P |P |P
<br>
>|P xIM xIM : : :
</blockquote>
</P>
<P>
</code></big>
Notice that in damping the vibrations of the second and third strings,
both the index and middle fingers of the `pluck' hand are used on
both strings.
</P>
<P>
On rare occasions, guitarists will substitute fingers on the fret-board
while a string remains sounding.
The following example illustrates such a finger-substitution where
the middle finger is replaced by the ring finger:
<code><big>
</P>
<P>
<blockquote>
| |2b |2c | | |
<br>
: :2b :2d : : :
</blockquote>
</code></big>
</P>
<P>
Note that in the
<b>**fret</b>
representation, no special signifiers are provided for
so-called `hammer-on' or (ascending-slur),
nor for the so-called `pull-off' or (descending-slur).
During the ascending-slur, the sound is produced simply
by engaging the next fret.
This can be represented in
<b>**fret</b>
by using the "let ring" signifier (:) in conjunction
with the appropriate fret notation.
The descending-slur can be similarly notated.
</P>
<P>
The
<b>**fret</b>
representation also provides several short-hand abbreviations
for common ornaments and effects.
Trills are indicated by the letters `t' (one semitone) and `T'
(two semitones).
Mordents are indicated by the letters `m' (one semitone) and `D'
(two semitones).
Inverted mordents are indicated by the letters `w' (one semitone) and `W'
(two semitones).
Turns are indicated by the letters `S' and `$' (for the inverted
"Wagnerian" turn).
Two types of vibrato are distinguished: `v' for transverse vibrato
and `V' for lateral vibrato.
Pitch bending is signified by the tilde (~).
</P>
<P>
Four types of
<i>percussion effects</i>
can be represented using
<b>**fret.</b>
The two most common
<i>tambours</i>
involve tapping on the bridge (represented by the lower-case letter `u')
and tapping on the strings near the bridge (represented by the
upper-case letter `U').
A simple `tap' on the top-plate is represented by the lower-case letter `y',
whereas a lower-pitched `thump' on the top-plate is represented by
the upper-case letter `Y'.
When sounded alone, these signifiers appear on a record by themselves.
When sounded in conjunction with a plucked or (uncommonly) bowed string,
these signifiers appear at the beginning of the tablature-token.
</P>
<P>
Apart from tablature-tokens,
<b>**fret</b>
also permits the encoding of rests and barlines.
Rest tokens are denoted simply by the lower-case letter `r'.
</P>
<P>
Barlines are represented using the "common system" for barlines
--  see <A HREF="barlines.rep.html"><b>barlines</b></A>.
