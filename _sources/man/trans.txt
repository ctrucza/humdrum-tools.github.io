COMMAND
~~~~~~~

**trans** -- transpose selected Humdrum pitch representations

--------------

SYNOPSIS
~~~~~~~~

`` trans  -d  [+-]n  [-c  [+-]n]  [-k keysig]  [inputfile ...]  [ > outputfile]``

--------------

DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~

The **trans** command transposes various Humdrum pitch representations.
Transposed outputs maintain proper pitch-interval spellings, except in
modal transposition; **trans** might be used to transpose a work up a
perfect fourth, or down an augmented third, or from major mode to
Phrygian. A "transposition interpretation" is appended to the output to
mark the score as having been transposed. By default, input key
signatures are retained in the output, however users can specify any
replacement key signature using the **-k** option.

The **trans** command is able to process those pitch-related
representations listed below. All other inputs are simply echoed in the
output. For descriptions of the various input representations refer to
Section 2 *(Representation Reference)* of this reference manual.

*Input representations processed by **trans**.*

Transpositions are transformations that shift all pitch-signifier values
up or down by some amount. Transpositions are specified by defining a
*diatonic offset* and a *chromatic offset.* The diatonic offset affects
only the pitch-letter name used to spell a note. The chromatic offset
affects only the number of semitones shifted from the original pitch
height.

For typical transpositions, both diatonic and chromatic offsets will
need to be specified. For example, in transposing up a minor third (e.g.
from C to E-flat), the diatonic offset is \`up two pitch-letter names,'
and the chromatic offset is \`up three semitones.' The appropriate
command invocation would be:

    `` trans -d +2 -c +3 input > output``

The plus signs above are optional; in their absence, **trans** assumes
an upward transposition. Note that negative offsets can be mixed with
positive offsets. For example, `` trans -d -1 -c +1`` will transpose the
pitch C to B double-sharp, and F flat to E sharp, etc. (i.e. down one
letter name, yet up one semitone).

Modal transpositions are invoked by simply omitting the chromatic offset
information. (See `EXAMPLES <#EXAMPLES>`__ below.)

It is recommended that output files produced using the **trans** command
should be given names with the distinguishing \`.tr' extension.

OPTIONS
~~~~~~~

The **trans** command provides the following options:

    +--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
    | -c [*+-*\ ]\ *n*   | transpose up(+) or down (-) *n* semitones               |
    +--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
    | -d [*+-*\ ]\ *n*   | transpose up(+) or down (-) *n* diatonic letter names   |
    +--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
    | **-h**             | displays a help screen summarizing the command syntax   |
    +--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
    | -k *keysig*        | replace all input key signatures by *keysig*            |
    +--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+

Options are specified in the command line.

Note that the **-d** "option" is manditory rather than optional.

By default, **trans** maintains any original input key signatures in the
transposed output. The **-k** option allows the user to specify a
replacement key signature. Either "pitch-class" (\*k[...]) or
"pitch-height" (\*K[...]) key signatures can be specified. (See the *key
signature* tandem interpretation -- Section 3.)

--------------

EXAMPLES
~~~~~~~~

The following examples illustrate the use of **trans.**

Transposition up a minor third differs from transposition up an
augmented second:

    `` trans -d +2 -c +3 milhaud  trans -d +1 -c +3 milhaud``

Enharmonic transpositions can be accomplished by defining the chromatic
offset as zero semitones. For example, the following command transposes
up a diminished second. It might be used to transpose from the key of
C-sharp to the key of D-flat.

    `` trans -d +1 -c 0 moonlight``

Transposition up or down an octave requires both a diatonic offset and a
corresponding chromatic offset of plus or minus 12 semitones. e.g.

    `` trans -d -7 -c -12 guitar``

In addition to exact pitch transpositions, **trans** can also perform
*modal* transpositions. Modal transpositions arise when the pitch letter
names are modified without regard for the precise semitone offset. To
invoke a modal transposition, simply omit the chromatic offset
specification. The following transposition changes diatonic pitch-letter
names (down by two pitch-letters) so that the pitch C will become A,
etc.

    `` trans -d -2 major > aeolian``

For inputs in major keys, the corresponding outputs will be in Aeolian
mode.

For some applications, two or more successive transpositions may be
necessary. For example, the following pipeline modifies inputs in major
keys so that they are in the tonic Dorian mode.

    `` trans -d +1 major | trans -d -1 -c -2 > dorian``

The first **trans** carries out a modal transposition -- up the interval
of a diatonic second. Thus, a work in D major would be placed in E
Dorian. The second **trans** returns the score down the precise interval
of a major second. Together, both transpositions would cause an input in
F major to be transformed to F Dorian; an input in B-flat major would be
transformed to B-flat Dorian, etc.

Whenever **trans** is invoked, it adds a tandem interpretation to the
output indicating that the output representation has been transposed and
is no longer at the original pitch. *Transposition tandem
interpretations* are similar in syntax to the **trans** command itself.
For example, the following tandem interpretation indicates that the
score has been transposed up a major second.

    `` *Trd1c2``

The tandem interpretation in effect echoes the operation of the original
transposition. If a score has undergone more than one transposition, the
associated tandem interpretations will be ordered beginning with the
most recent transposition. For example, a work that was transposed down
a perfect fourth, followed by up a diminished second:

    `` trans -d -3 -c -5  trans -d +1 -c 0``

would contain the tandem interpretation:

    `` *Trd1c0  *Trd-3c-5``

WARNINGS
~~~~~~~~

It is important not to confused transposed scores with notations of
music for transposing instruments (such as the horn in F or the clarinet
in B-flat). The ``**pitch, **kern, **Tonh``, and ``**solfg``
representations are intended to represent absolute or concert pitch;
transposed scores are considered deviations from this convention. The
*transpose tandem interpretation* should not be used to indicate that an
encoding is for a transposing instrument. A special tandem
interpretation -- beginning `` *ITr`` -- is reserved for such
designations. The interpretation `` *Tr`` means that the encoding no
longer represents absolute or concert pitch. By contrast, the
interpretation `` *ITr`` means that the instrumentalist reads from a
score whose pitches are notated differently from concert pitch;
nevertheless, the ensuing data is encoded at concert pitch. For example,
a trumpet in B-flat plays a B-flat by fingering the pitch C. The
absolute pitch (B-flat) is the proper ``**kern, **pitch, **solfg``, or
``**Tonh`` encoding. Since the instrumentalist's *notation* is
transposed up 1 diatonic letter-name and 2 chromatic semitones from the
absolute or concert pitch, the encoded score will contain the
instrument's transposition tandem interpretation

    `` *ITrd1c2``

(even though the encoded data is at concert pitch). Note that it is
possible subsequently to transpose such a score using the **trans**
command.

Note that by default, key and key signature tandem interpretations are
not modified by **trans** since the ``**pitch, **kern, **solfg``, and
``**Tonh`` representations are intended to encode the original key and
key signature at absolute pitch.
