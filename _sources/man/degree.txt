Command: degree
================================

**degree** -- translate selected Humdrum pitch-related representations
to absolute scale degree (``**degree``)

SYNOPSIS
~~~~~~~~

`` degree  [k|K key] [-tx]  [inputfile ...]  [> outputfile.dgr]``

--------------

DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~

The **degree** command transforms various pitch-related inputs to the
corresponding scale degree. The command outputs one or more Humdrum
``**degree`` spines -- where scale degrees are indicated by the numbers
1 (tonic) to 7 (leading tone). Scale degree information can be
determined only with reference to some prevailing key. For example, the
pitch C4 is the tonic (1) in the key of C major, but the submediant (6)
in the key of E minor. The **degree** command expects a tandem
interpretation indicating the key of the input passage; **degree** will
adapt to specified changes of key within an input. If no key information
is provided prior to the first pitch-related data, **degree** issues an
error message and terminates.

The **degree** command differs from the (related) `**deg** <deg.html>`__
command in that it outputs *absolute* (rather than *relative)*
pitch-height information. Along with the scale degree, the octave number
is represented -- the two values being separated by a slash (/). Hence
the token \`1/4' means the first scale degree (tonic) in octave \`4'. As
in the case of `**deg**, <deg.html>`__ plus and minus signs indicate
whether a pitch has been chromatically raised or lowered. For example,
the pitch A-flat is designated \`6-' in the key of C major, but \`6' in
the key of C minor. The harmonic minor scale is assumed for all minor
keys. Thus, B-flat is considered a "lowered" seventh degree in C minor,
whereas B natural is considered the "normal" (rather than "raised")
seventh degree. For some applications, this interpretation of the
minor-scale seventh degree may cause difficulties.

The **degree** command is able to translate any of the pitch-related
representations listed below. For descriptions of the various input
representations (including ``**degree``) refer to Section 2
*(Representation Reference)* of this reference manual.

It is recommended that output files produced using the **dgr** command
should be given names with the distinguishing \`.dgr' extension.

OPTIONS
~~~~~~~

The **degree** command provides the following options:

        **-h**

        displays a help screen summarizing the command syntax

        -k *key*

        specify default key

        -K *key*

        specify override key

        **-t**

        suppresses printing of all but the first note of a group of tied
        ``**kern notes``

        **-x**

        suppresses printing of
        non-``**degree signifiers   Options are specified in the command line. ``

        The **-t** option ensures that only a single output value is
        given for tied ``**kern`` notes; the output coincides with the
        first note of the tie.

        In the default operation, **degree** outputs non-pitch-related
        signifiers in addition to the degree value. For example, in the
        key of D major, the ``**pitch`` token "G5zzz" will result in the
        output "4/5zzz" -- that is, after translating G5 to 4/5, the
        "zzz" signifiers are retained in the output. For some
        applications, echoing non-pitch-related signifiers in the output
        is useful. However, in other situations, the result can prove
        confusing -- especially, when the non-pitch-related signifiers
        are numbers. Consider the case of the ``**kern`` token "4f#" in
        the key of D minor; after translating \`\ ``f#``' to
        \`\ ``3+/4``' (i.e. raised third degree in octave 4), the
        preceding non-pitch-related signifier \`\ ``4``' will also be
        output, hence the value ``43+/4`` -- which may cause confusion.

        The **-x** option is useful for eliminating non-pitch-related
        signifiers from the output. For most ``**kern`` inputs, the
        **-x** option is recommended.

        EXAMPLES
        ~~~~~~~~

        The following example illustrates the use of **degree.** The
        input contains four pitch-related spines -- one of which
        (``**MIDI``) cannot be processed by **degree.** In addition,
        there is one non-pitch-related spines (``**embell``). ````

        Both processed and unprocessed spines are output. Notice that
        the tied note at the beginning of measure 2 in the ``**kern``
        spine has been rendered as a single note rather than as two
        notes (due to the **-t** option). Also notice that the
        non-pitch-related signifiers (e.g. foo) in the first notes of
        the ``**pitch`` spine have been stripped away (due to the **-x**
        option). Note that the plus and minus signs merely indicate that
        a scale degree has been raised or lowered, but not by how much.
        Hence both the D-flat and D double-flat in measure 1 of the
        first (``**kern)`` spine are rendered as degree \`\ ``2-``'.
