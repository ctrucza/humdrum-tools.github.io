Command: deg 
================================

**deg** -- translate selected Humdrum pitch-related representations to
relative scale degree (``**deg``)

SYNOPSIS
~~~~~~~~

`` deg  [-k|K key] [-tx]  [inputfile ...]  [> outputfile.deg]``

--------------

DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~

The **deg** command transforms various pitch-related inputs to the
corresponding scale degree. The command outputs one or more Humdrum
``**deg`` spines -- where scale degrees are indicated by the numbers 1
(tonic) to 7 (leading tone). Scale degree information can be determined
only with reference to some prevailing key. For example, the pitch C4 is
the tonic (1) in the key of C major, but the submediant (6) in the key
of E minor. The **deg** command expects a tandem interpretation
indicating the key of the input passage; **deg** will adapt to specified
changes of key within an input. If no key information is provided prior
to the first pitch-related data, **deg** issues an error message and
terminates.

The **deg** command differs from the (related)
`**degree** <degree.html>`__ command in that it outputs *relative*
(rather than *absolute)* pitch-height information. Upward pitch motions
are indicated by the caret (^), whereas downward pitch motions are
indicated by the lower-case letter \`v'. Hence, the token \`1' followed
by \`^5' means that the ensuing dominant pitch is above rather than
below the preceding tonic pitch. No absolute pitch-height information is
represented. As in the case of `**degree**, <degree.html>`__ plus and
minus signs indicate whether a pitch has been chromatically raised or
lowered. For example, the pitch A-flat is designated \`6-' in the key of
C major, but \`6' in the key of C minor. The harmonic minor scale is
assumed for all minor keys. Thus, B-flat is considered a "lowered"
seventh degree in C minor, whereas B natural is considered the "normal"
(rather than "raised") seventh degree. For some applications, this
interpretation of the minor-scale seventh degree may cause difficulties.

The **deg** command is able to translate any of the pitch-related
representations listed below. For descriptions of the various input
representations (including ``**deg``) refer to Section 2
*(Representation Reference)* of this reference manual.

It is recommended that output files produced using the **deg** command
should be given names with the distinguishing \`.deg' extension.

OPTIONS
~~~~~~~

The **deg** command provides the following options:

        **-h**

        displays a help screen summarizing the command syntax

        -k *key*

        specify default key

        -K *key*

        specify override key

        **-t**

        suppresses printing of all but the first note of a group of tied
        ``**kern notes``

        **-x**

        suppresses printing of
        non-``**deg signifiers   Options are specified in the command line. ``

        The **-t** option ensures that only a single output value is
        given for tied ``**kern`` notes; the output coincides with the
        first note of the tie.

        In the default operation, **deg** outputs non-pitch-related
        signifiers in addition to the degree value. For example, in the
        key of D major, the ``**pitch`` token "G5zzz" will result in the
        output "4zzz" -- that is, after translating G5 to 4, the "zzz"
        signifiers are retained in the output. For some applications,
        echoing non-pitch-related signifiers in the output is useful.
        However, in other situations, the result can prove confusing --
        especially, when the non-pitch-related signifiers are numbers.
        Consider the case of the ``**kern`` token "4f#" in the key of D
        minor; after translating \`\ ``f#``' to \`\ ``3+``' (i.e. raised
        third degree), the preceding non-pitch-related signifier
        \`\ ``4``' will also be output, hence the value ``43+`` -- which
        may cause confusion.

        The **-x** option is useful for eliminating non-pitch-related
        signifiers from the output. For most ``**kern`` inputs, the
        **-x** option is recommended.

        EXAMPLES
        ~~~~~~~~

        The following example illustrates the use of **deg.** The input
        contains four pitch-related spines -- one of which (``**MIDI``)
        cannot be processed by **deg.** In addition, there is one
        non-pitch-related spines (``**embell``).

        Both processed and unprocessed spines are output. Notice that
        the tied note at the beginning of measure 2 in the ``**kern``
        spine has been rendered as a single note rather than as two
        notes (due to the **-t** option). Also notice that the
        non-pitch-related signifiers (e.g. foo) in the first notes of
        the ``**pitch`` spine have been stripped away (due to the **-x**
        option). Note that the plus and minus signs merely indicate that
        a scale degree has been raised or lowered, but not by how much.
        Hence both the D-flat and D double-flat in measure 1 of the
        first (``**kern``) spine are rendered as \`\ ``2-``'.
