Humdrum Developer's Guide
=========================

--------

The pages accessible from this site offer advice and direction for those
users wanting to expand or tailor Humdrum so as to better suit a given
musical application. Two types of extensions are possible:

-   Users may wish to define one or more new representation schemes that
    better represent the types of information of interest. For example, a
    user might define a new Humdrum representation scheme suitable for
    representing North Indian *tabla bols.* The `**Representation
    Development**`_ provides guidelines for defining new Humdrum
    representations. The approach is illustrated using a `**sample
    problem**`_ of representing fingering for keyboard instruments.


-   Users might wish to develop new software tools that manipulate one or
    more Humdrum representations in some fashion. For example, the user might
    create a command that identifies the roots of chords. The `**Software
    Development**`_ provides tips for writing adjunct software. In addition,
    a standard *program skeleton* is described.

A `**bibliography**`_ of materials relevant to software development is also
available.

The process of translating from MuseData to Humdrum is described in a
document concerning `**preparation of electronic editions**.`_

This site is derived from Section 7 of the Humdrum *Reference Manual*.
