Welcome
===============

Welcome to the new website for the Humdrum tools for computational music analysis. 
Here you will find instructions on downloading, installing, and using the Humdrum Toolkit. 

We've split the site into the Humdrum User Guide (Huron, 1995), an explanation of the Craig Sapp's Humdrum
Extras, and a Humdrum Cookbook.
