The Shell (III)
===============

--------

In `Chapter 16`_ we learned about the **alias** feature of the shell. The
**alias** command allowed us to create new commands by assigning a complex
pipeline to a single-word command. In this chapter we will learn how to use
the shell to write more complex programs. Shell programs allow users to
reduce lengthy sequences of Humdrum commands to a single user-defined
command.


Shell Programs
--------------

A shell program is simply a script consisting of one or more shell commands.
Suppose we had a complex procedure consisting of a number of commands and
pipelines:

`` extract -i '**Ursatz' inputfile | humsed '/X/d' \

>
>> | context -o Y -b Z > Ursatz``
>
`` extract -i '**Urlinie' inputfile | humsed '/X/d' \

>
>> | context -o Y -b Z > Urlinie
>
> assemble Ursatz Urlinie | rid -GLId | graph``

In the above hypothetical script, we have processed an input file called
`` inputfile``. It may be that this is a procedure we would like to apply to
several different files. Rather than typing the above command sequence for
each file, an alternative is to place the above commands in a file. Let's
assume that we put the above commands in a file called ``Schenker``. In order
to execute this file as a shell script, we need to assign *execute
permissions* to the file. We can do this by invoking the UNIX **chmod**
command.

`` chmod +x Schenker``

The **+x** option causes **chmod** to add execute permissions to the file
`` Schenker``. Using **chmod** we can change modes related to *executing* a
file, *reading* a file, and *writing* to a file. Possible mode changes
include the following:

> +xadd execute permission
> -xdeny execute permission
> +radd read permission
> -rdeny read permission
> +wadd write permission
> -wdeny write permission

Having added execute permissions to the file, we can now execute the shell
script or program. This is done simply by typing the name of the file; in
effect, the filename becomes a new command:

`` Schenker``

Each time we type this command, our script will be executed anew. Notice that
in our script, the final output has not been sent to a file. As a result, the
output from our **Schenker** command will be sent to the screen (standard
output). It is convenient not to specify an output file in the script since
this is often something the user would like to specify. When typing our new
command, we can use file-redirection to place the output in a user-specified
file:

`` Schenker > outputfile``

As currently written, our program can be applied only to an input file whose
name is literally ``inputfile``. If we wanted to, we could edit our script
and update the name of the input filename every time we want to use the
command. However, it would be more convenient to specify the input filename
on the command line -- as we can do for other commands. For example, it would
be convenient to be able to type commands such as the following:

`` Schenker opus118 > opus118.out``

In order to allow such a possibility, we can use a predefined feature of the
shell. Whenever the shell receives a command, each item of information on the
command line is assigned to a shell variable. The first item on the command
line is assigned to the variable $0 (normally, this is the command name). For
example, in the above example, $0 is assigned the string value
"``Schenker``." The variables $1, $2, $3, etc. are assigned to each
successive item of information on the command line. So in the above example,
$1 is assigned the string value "``opus118``."

These shell variables can be accessed within the shell script itself. We need
to revise the script so that each occurrence of the input file is replaced by
the variable $1:

`` extract -i '**Ursatz' $1 | humsed '/X/d' \

>
>> | context -o Y -b Z > Ursatz``
>
`` extract -i '**Urlinie' $1 | humsed '/X/d' \

>
>> | context -o Y -b Z > Urlinie
>
> assemble Ursatz Urlinie | rid -GLId | graph``

This change means that our **Schenker** command can be applied to any user-
specified input file -- simply by typing the filename in the command.


Flow of Control: The *if* Statement
----------

Suppose we wanted our **Schenker** command to apply only to tonal works --
more specifically, to works with a known key. Before processing a work, we
might want to have **Schenker** test for the presence of a tandem
interpretation specifying the key.

Let's begin by using **grep** to search for a key tandem interpretation. An
appropriate **grep** command would be:

`` grep '^\*[A-Ga-g][#-]*:' $1``

Recall that we can assign the output of any command to a shell variable by
placing the command within back-quotes or greves, i.e. `...`. Let's assign
the key interpretation to the variable KEY:

`` KEY=`grep '^\*[A-Ga-g][#-]*:' $1```

If no key indicator is found by **grep**, then the variable KEY will be
empty. We can test for this condition using the shell **if** statement.

`` KEY=`grep '^\*[A-Ga-g][#-]*:' $1`
if [ "$KEY" = "" ]
then
>
>> echo "Sorry, this input file has no key."
exit
>
> fi``

Notice that we use the dollars sign prior to the variable to mean *the
contents of variable KEY*. The double quotation marks allow a string
comparison. Our test is whether the variable $KEY is equivalent to the empty
or null string "". If the test is true, then the commands following the
`` then`` statement are executed. By convention, these commands are indented
for clarity. In the above case, two commands are executed if the $KEY
variable is empty. The **echo** command causes the quoted string to be
output. The **exit** command causes the script to terminate. Notice the
presence of the **fi** command (**if** backwards). This command simply
indicates that the if-block has ended.

Of course, if there is a key designation, then it is appropriate to execute
the rest of our **Schenker** script. The complete script would be as follows:

`` KEY=`grep '^\*[A-Ga-g][#-]*:' $1`
if [ "$KEY" = "" ]
then
>
>> echo "Sorry, this input file has no key." exit
>
> else``
>
>``extract -i '**Ursatz' $1 | humsed '/X/d' \

>>
>>> | context -o Y -b Z > Ursatz``
>>
>``extract -i '**Urlinie' $1 | humsed '/X/d' \

>>
>>> | context -o Y -b Z > Urlinie
>>
>> assemble Ursatz Urlinie | rid -GLId | graph
>
> fi``

Notice the addition of the **else** statement. The **else** statement
delineates the block of commands to be executed whenever the **if** condition
fails -- that is, when the $KEY variable does *not* equal the null string.
Once again, to make the script more readable, we indent the commands
contained in the else-block.

The **if** command provides many other ways of testing some condition. For
example, the shell provides ways to determine whether a file exists, and
other features.


Flow of Control: The *for* Statement
----------

In music research, a common task is to apply a particular process or script
to a large number of score files. By way of illustration, suppose we wanted
to know the maximum number of notes in any single folk melody in a collection
of Czech folksongs. Suppose further that we are located in a directory
containing a large number of Czech folksongs named ``czech01.krn``,
`` czech02.krn``, ``czech03.krn``, and so on.

We would like to run the **census -k** command on each file separately, but
we'd prefer not to type the command for each score. The **for** statement
provides a convenient way to do this. The following commands might be typed
directly at the shell:

`` for J in czech*.krn
> do
> census -k $J | grep 'Number of notes:'
> done | sort -n``

The pattern ``czech*.krn`` will be expanded to all of the files in the
current directory that it matches. The variable **J** will take on each name
in turn. The commands between **do** and **done** will be executed for each
value of the variable **$J**. That is, initially **$J** will have the value
`` czech01.krn``. Having completed the do-done block of commands, the value of
**$J** will become ``czech02.krn``, and the do-done block will be repeated.
This will continue until the value of **$J** has taken on all of the possible
matches for ``czech*.krn``.

The output might appear as follows:

`` Number of notes: 31
Number of notes: 32
Number of notes: 32
Number of notes: 34
Number of notes: 35
Number of notes: 39
Number of notes: 39
Number of notes: 40
Number of notes: 48
Number of notes: 48
Number of notes: 55
Number of notes: 78``
etc.

Incidentally, the output from a **for** construction such as above can be
piped to further commands, so we might identify the maximum number of notes
in a Czech melody by piping the output through **sort -n**.


A Script for Identifying Transgressions of Voice-Leading
--------------------------------------------------------

Shell programs can be of arbitrary complexity. Below is a shell program
(dubbed **leader**) whose purpose is to identify all instances of betrayals
of nine classic rules of voice-leading for a two-part input. A number of
refinements have been added to the program -- including input file checking,
and formatting of the output.

The program is invoked as follows:

`` leader ``

The input is assumed to contain two voices, each in a separate ```**kern```_
spine. The nominally lower voice should be in the first spine. For music
containing more than two voices, the Humdrum **extract** command should be
used to select successive pairs of voices for processing by **leader**.

`` # LEADER
#
# A shell program to check for voice-leading infractions.
# This command is invoked as:
#
# leader
#
# where  is assumed to be a file containing two voices, each
# in a separate **kern spine, where the nominally lower voice is in the
# first spine.

# Before processing, ensure that a proper input file has been specified.
if [ ! -f $1 ]
then echo "leader: file $1 not found"
exit
fi
if [ $# -eq 0 ]
then echo "leader: input file not specified"
exit
fi

# 1. Record the ranges for the two voices.
echo 'Range for Upper voice:'
extract -f 2 $1 | census -k | egrep 'Highest|Lowest' | sed 's/^/ /'

Reprise

In this chapter we have illustrated how to package complex Humdrum command
scripts into shell programs. This allows us to create special-purpose
commands. We learned that files can be transformed into executable scripts
through the **chmod** command. We also learned how to pass parameters from
the command line to the script, and how to assign and modify the contents of
variables. In addition, we learned how to influence the flow of control using
the **if** and **for** statements. Finally, we learned that multi-line
scripts can be typed directly at the command line without creating a script
file.

Shell scripts can be very brief or very long. It is possible to create
scripts that carry out highly sophisticated processing such as searching for
voice-leading transgressions. There are innumerable features to shell
programming that have not been touched-on in this chapter. Several books are
available that provide comprehensive tutorials for shell programming.


Locating Violations of the Rules of Voice-Leading
-------------------------------------------------

The traditional rules of voice-leading have formed a standard component of
conservatory training for art musicians.

For illustration purposes, we'll apply some of the Humdrum tools to the
problem of identifying betrayals of the classic rules of voice-leading in a
`` **kern``-encoded score. Note that our purpose here is not to legislate how
to compose or arrange! We're simply using the traditional voice-leading rules
as a way to introduce various pattern-searching techniques.


(1) Parts Out Of Range
----------------------


RULE: "Avoid parts that are out of range."
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The Humdrum **census** command provides a summary of various elementary
features of any Humdrum input. With the **-k** option, **census** provides a
summary of a further ten features pertaining to ``**kern`` format inputs.
This includes the highest and lowest notes present.

`` census -k ``

Since we are interested in the highest and lowest notes for each individual
part (rather than for the whole piece), we should **extract** each part
before processing it with **census.**

`` extract -i '*soprano'  > soprano.part``
`` census -k soprano.part``

On UNIX, a set of commands that sequentially process a given input can be
joined together as a "pipeline". A pipeline feeds the output of one process
to the input of another process. This means that we can simplify the above
sequence of commands into a single pipeline:

`` extract -i '*soprano'  | census -k``

We could then repeat the pipeline for each voice present:

`` extract -i '*alto'  | census -k
extract -i '*tenor'  | census -k
extract -i '*bass'  | census -k``

If we wanted to get a little fancier, we could filter the output so that only
the highest and lowest pitch information is output. The UNIX **grep** command
will let us define a string for searching; **egrep** permits compound
strings, such as the use of the OR bar (|):

`` extract -i '*soprano'  | census -k | egrep 'Highest|Lowest'``


(2) Augmented/Diminished Melodic Intervals
------------------------------------------


RULE: "Avoid parts that move by augmented or diminished intervals.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Implementing this is simple. We first translate our pitch- related data to
the melodic interval format -- ```**mint```_. This can be done using the
Humdrum **mint** command. For example, consider the following melodic
fragment from the 2nd movement of Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 5:



`` **kern
> 8r
> 8f#
> 8b
> 16.cc#
> 32dd
> 8a#
> 16.b
> 32cc#
> 8dd
> *-``

Given this input, the **mint** command will produce the following output.
Plus signs indicate ascending intervals, while minus signs indicate
descending intervals; 'P' means perfect, 'M' means major, 'm' means minor,
'A' means augmented, and 'd' means diminished:



`` **mint
> [f#]
> +P4
> +M2
> +m2
> -d4
> +m2
> +M2
> +m2
> *-``

Searching for diminished or augmented intervals is as simple as using the
Unix **grep** command, with the appropriate regular expression:

`` grep -n '[Ad]' ``

The **-n** option will cause **grep** to prepend the line number of any
matching patterns, so we can refer back to the original input file.

In order to avoid the letters `A' or `d' found in comments or
interpretations, we might consider using the Humdrum **rid** command:

`` rid -GLI  | grep -n '[Ad]'``

However, this will cause the line numbers output by **grep** to be wrong. The
line numbers will correspond to the input file with the comments and
interpretations removed.

A better approach is to send the complete file to **grep**, and use a more
circumspect regular expression to eliminate comments and interpretations
within **grep**. **egrep** allows us to define more complex regular
expressions:

`` egrep '^[^!*].*[Ad]'``

The expression `^[^!*]' means "not an exclamation mark or asterisk at the
beginning of a line." The expression `.*[Ad]' means "zero or more instances
of any character followed by either an upper-case letter `A' or a lower-case
letter `d'.

In other words, the complete regular expression matches any line that
contains either an upper-case `A' or lower-case `d' as long as the beginning
of the line does not start with an exclamation mark (i.e. Humdrum comment) or
an asterisk (i.e. Humdrum interpretation).

If we want to look for augmented or diminished intervals in a particular part
or voice, we would begin by using the **extract** command to isolate the
voice of interest.

Finally, putting all of the elements together in a Unix pipeline, we get the
following command for identifying augmented or diminished melodic intervals:

`` extract -i 'alto'  | mint | egrep -n '^[^!*].*[Ad]'``

If there is no output, then there are no augmented or diminished intervals
present.


(3) Consecutive Fifths or Octaves
---------------------------------


RULE: "Avoid consecutive fifths and octaves between any two parts.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Let's focus on identifying consecutive fifths -- since the process is the
same for octaves.

Either the Humdrum **patt** or **pattern** commands can be used to find
patterns that span more than one line or record. For this example, we'll use
**patt**.

First, we need to reformat our input so the data represent harmonic intervals
rather than pitches. The Humdrum **hint** command will change most pitch
representations to the harmonic interval representation -- ```**hint```_.
Consider, for example, the following input:



`` **kern **kern
> =1 =1
> 4c 4e
> 4G 4d
> =2 =2
> 2F 2c
> *- *-``

Given the following command:

`` hint ``

The following output will be produced:



`` **hint
> =1
> M3
> P5
> =2
> P5
> *-``

(Notice that, in this case, the consecutive fifths are separated by a
barline.)

Second, we need to define a pattern template for the **patt** command. The
template is a series of one or more regular expressions that are stored in a
separate file. In this case the pattern is trivial: just two consecutive
perfect fifth tokens. We might store the following pattern in the file
"template":



`` P5
> P5``

(Note that if we were looking for consecutive `fifths' that need not
necessarily be `perfect,' we could simply eliminate the letter "P" in each
interval given in the template.)

Given the above output from the **hint** command, we could search for
occurrences of the defined pattern using the following command:

> The **-f** option is used to identify the file (``template``) in which the
pattern-template has been stored. The **-s** option tells **patt** of any
input records that should be skipped during the search process. The **-s**
option is followed by a regular expression -- in this case the equals-sign --
so that any input records containing the equals-sign (i.e. ``**hint``
barlines) are ignored.

The default output from **patt** identifies the location of any instances of
the pattern it finds in the source document.

The appropriate pipeline is:

`` hint  | patt -f template -s =``

There are a few refinements we ought to add to this process. Currently, we
are searching for parallel perfect fifths only. The consecutive fifths rule
pertains to all intervals that are compound-equivalents to perfect fifths
(such as perfect twelfths, etc.).

This additional criteria is easily handled. The **hint** command provides a
**-c** option that causes all compound intervals to be represented by their
non-compound equivalents. For example, major tenths and major seventheenths,
etc. will all be represented as "M3", and so on. Hence we would modify our
pipeline:

`` hint -c  | patt -f template -s =``

(Note that an alternative way of handling the compound-intervals question
would be to define slightly more complex regular expressions in our template
file, e.g.



`` P5|P12|P19
> P5|P12|P19``

In regular expressions the vertical bar (|) denotes the logical `OR'
operation. So the above pattern says "a perfect fifth OR a perfect twelfth OR
a perfect nineteenth followed by a ...")

Another refinement relates to the selection of voices. So far, we have
presumed that the input consists of just two Humdrum spines containing
separate parts. In a multi-part score, we must examine each pair of voices in
turn, in order to determine whether any pair exhibit consecutive fifths or
octaves.

The simplest (but more tedious) approach, is simply to execute our command
pipeline for each pairing of voices. For example, in a traditional four-part
harmonization:

`` extract -i '*soprano,*alto'  | hint -c | patt -f template -s =
extract -i '*soprano,*tenor'  | hint -c | patt -f template -s =
extract -i '*soprano,*bass'  | hint -c | patt -f template -s =
extract -i '*alto,*tenor'  | hint -c | patt -f template -s =
extract -i '*alto,*bass'  | hint -c | patt -f template -s =
extract -i '*tenor,*bass'  | hint -c | patt -f template -s =``

(There are shorter ways of doing these permutations that involves a little
shell programming, but we'll leave that for another time.)


(4) Doubled Leading Tone
------------------------


RULE: "Avoid doubling the leading-tone."
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Pitches can be identified as "leading-tones" only when we have some idea of
their key-related scale-degree. The Humdrum **deg** command translates pitch
representations to a scale-degree representation where the numbers 1 to 7
represent tonic to leading-tone designations.

Notice that the score input must contain an explicit key indication (a
special type of Humdrum tandem interpretation). For example, the key of G
major is indicated through the presence of the following interpretation:



`` *G:``

Minor keys are indicated using lower-case characters. For example, the
following passage is in B minor:



`` **kern
> *b:
> 8r
> 8f#
> 8b
> 16.cc#
> 32dd
> 8a#
> 16.b
> 32cc#
> 8dd
> *-``

The **deg** command can be used to transform this representation to scale
degree. The passage begins on the dominant (degree `5'), ascends (^) to the
tonic (`1'), ascends to the supertonic (^2), ascends to the median (^3) and
then descends to the leading- tone (v7), etc.:



`` **deg
> *b:
> 5
> ^1
> ^2
> ^3
> v7
> ^1
> ^2
> ^3
> *-``

The following command will eliminate durations or other possible number
representations that might conflict with scale-degree designations:

`` deg ``

Having translated the representation in this way, we need to search for any
lines which contain two instances of the number `7' -- that is, two
concurrent instances of the leading-tone.

Searching for the number `7' is easily done using the standard Unix **grep**
(get regular expression) command:

`` deg  | grep -n '7'``

This will find and output all records that contain the number 7; the **-n**
option means that the corresponding line number will also be output.

However, we want to find instances where two or more 7s occur on a single
line. For this, we can use a slightly more complex regular expression

`` deg  | grep -n '7.*7'``

In the construction ".*" the period (.) means any character, and the asterisk
means "zero or more instances of ..." Hence, the regular expression means
"the number 7 followed by zero or more instances of any character, followed
by the number 7". In short, this expression will match any record in which
the number 7 occurs at least twice.

As in the case of our earlier search for augmented and diminished intervals,
**grep** is insensitive to whether the matching character string is found in
a data record, or whether it occurs in a Humdrum comment or interpretation.
In order to avoid matching comments or interpretations, a further refinement
to our regular expression is appropriate.

`` deg  | egrep -n '^7.*7|^[^!*].*7.*7'``

In this case, the regular expression says the following: "find any occurrence
of the number 7 at the beginning of the line followed by zero or more
characters followed by the number 7; or match any character at the beginning
of the line -- other than an exclamation mark or an asterisk -- followed by
zero or more characters, followed by the number 7, followed by zero or more
characters, followed by another number 7.

Depending on the input, it is possible that Humdrum spines will be present
that do not represent scale degree information. It is possible that these
other kinds of data may also make use of the number 7 -- but *not* to
represent the leading-tone. In other words, it is possible that a matching
`7' has nothing to do with scale degrees. We can ensure that this doesn't
happen by first ensuring that *only* scale-degree spines are present in the
input to be searched.

In order to do this, we can use the Humdrum **extract** command as a filter,
and identify the types of interpretations we want to pass. In the following
modification to our pipe, the **extract** command has been used to ensure
that only ```**deg```_ spines are present:

`` deg  | extract -i '**deg' | egrep -n '^7.*7|^[^!*].*7.*7'``

There are still some refinements that we could add to this command sequence,
but as it stands it is guaranteed to find all doubled leading-tones --
provided the notes begin at the same time. Consider the following
hypothetical passage:



`` **kern **kern
> *C: *C:
> 8c 8g
> =1 =1
> 4B 8g
> . 16a
> . 16b
> 4A 4cc
> *- *-``

Given the above command sequence, no doubled leading-tones would be
identified in this passage. However, we might wish to implement a more
stringent criterion that would seek out any instances where the leading-tone
sounds at the same time in more than one voice. This occurs in the above
example with the sixteenth-note B concurrent with the held quarter-note B in
the other part.

This criterion can be accommodated by a further refinement to our command
pipeline. The Humdrum **ditto** command is used to replace null data tokens
by the immediately preceding data token in the same spine. Consider first,
the output from the **deg** command for the above example:



`` **deg **deg
> *C: *C:
> 1 5
> =1 =1
> v7 5
> . ^6
> . ^7
> v6 ^1
> *- *-``

If we now invoke the **ditto** command, the modified output is:



`` **deg **deg
> *C: *C:
> 1 5
> =1 =1
> v7 5
> v7 ^6
> v7 ^7
> v6 ^1
> *- *-``

Notice that the two null tokens in the left-hand spine have been replaced by
copies of the most recent data token. Now our **grep** command will find the
two leading tones in the second last data record.

In summary, the complete command pipeline would be:

`` deg  | extract -i '**deg' | ditto -s = | egrep -n '^7.*7|^[^!*].*7.*7'``

This may seem somewhat complicated, but the basic structure of this pipeline
is suitable for a very wide variety of pattern searches.


(5) Avoid Unisons
-----------------


RULE: "Avoid the sharing of pitches by two parts."
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

For this rule, let's assume that we also want to identify unisons that are
spelled enharmonically (such as F-sharp and G-flat).

First, we need to translate the two parts into some absolute pitch
representation -- such as frequency or semitones. This will ensure that
enharmonically equivalent pitches have the same representation -- and so will
facilitate comparison.

The Humdrum **semits** command translates pitches to semitone distances where
middle C is denoted as zero. For example, where two voices both play B3 at
the same time, both the parts will have a ```**semits```_ value of minus one
(-1).

Like the **deg** command, the **semits** command provides a **"-x** option
that eliminates from the output stream any characters that don't pertain to
semitones. Hence the following command will eliminate durations or other
possible numerical representations that might conflict with semitone
designations:

`` extract -i '*alto,*tenor'``* *`` | semits -x``

Next we need to compare the two parts at each moment in order to determine
whether they have the same numerical value. The Unix **awk** command will
allow us to do some arithmetic. Awk auto- matically parses an input, so the
value of the first spine is referred to as `$1', the value of the second
spine is `$2' and so on. The **awk** expression ```1==$2'`` is a test of
whether the first and second spines are equivalent. The **awk** action
`` `print NR'`` means to print the current line number (record number is
`` `NR'``).

So the following command will print the line number for any input in which
the semitone value is the same for both the alto and tenor voices:

`` extract -i '*alto,*tenor'  | semits -x | awk '{if($1==$2) print NR}'``

There is a problem with this pipeline however. The **awk** command will match
all sorts of non-numeric inputs -- such as where null tokens (.) occur in
both parts at the same time. Consequently, we need to be careful to avoid
non-numeric inputs and comments.

The regular expression `[^0-9]' will match any line that doesn't consist
solely of numbers. The expression `[^0-9-]' will match any line that doesn't
consist solely of numbers or the minus sign. Since the tab character will
also be present in our data records, we should also include the tab in our
regular expression. The tab may be denoted in regular expressions by the
lower-case letter `t' preceded by a backslash. Hence the expression
`[^0-9\t-]' will match only those lines consisting solely of numbers, the
minus sign, and tabs.

The following **awk** script will output the line numbers for all inputs
where the first and second spines contain identical numbers:

`` awk '{if($0~/[^0-9\t-]/)next}{if($1==$2) print NR}'``

Adding this construction to our pipeline produces the following command for
identifying unisons:

`` extract -f 1,2  | semits -x | ditto -s = | awk
'{if($0~/[^0-9\t-]/)next}{if($1==$2) print NR}'``


(6) Crossed Parts
-----------------


RULE: "Avoid the crossing of parts."
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Part-crossing occurs when a nominally higher voice uses a pitch that is lower
than a nominally lower voice.

The relations "higher" and "lower" suggest the use of an arithmetic operator
such as greater-than (>) or less-than (<). In brief, we will approach this
question by translating the pitches to a numerical scale, and then use the
general-purpose Unix **awk** command to test whether the nominally lower
voice is truly lower.

First we need to translate the pitch representation to some sort of numerical
form. We have several options. We could translate the pitches to frequency
(```**freq```_), or we could translate them to semitones (``**semits``), or
we could translate them to cents (**cents). Let's use ``**semits``. Once
again, in this representation, middle-C is represented by the number zero,
and all other pitches are represented by their semitone distance (positive or
negative) with respect to this reference.

We extract the two parts of interest, and then translate them to the semitone
numerical representation:

`` extract -i '*soprano,*alto'  | semits -x``

Since part-crossing may occur when one voice is holding a note, we should use
the Humdrum **ditto** command, as we did for the doubled leading-tone
problem. Hence:

`` extract -i '*alto,*tenor'  | semits -x | ditto -s =``

Finally, we can use the Unix **awk** command to do a little arithmetic. Once
again, in **awk**, ```1'`` and ``2'`` refer to the first and second input
fields, and the built-in variable ```NR'`` refers to the current record
(line) number. The expression ```{if($1>$2) print NR}'`` is a miniature
program that says: "if the first input field is numerically greater than the
second field for the current line, then print the line number":

`` extract -i '*alto,*tenor'  | semits -x | ditto -s = | awk '{if($1>$2)
print NR}'``

In short, if the left-most spine has a lower numerical value than the second
spine, then tell us where that occurs.

Since the ``**semits`` representation uses the lower-case letter `r' to
represent a rest, we should avoid the possibility of comparing a number
(note) with a rest. We can use a variation on the same **awk** script as we
used when checking for unisons:

`` awk '{if($0~/[^0-9\t-]/)next}{if($1>$2) print NR}'``

Finally, the complete pipeline for identifying crossed parts:

`` extract -i '*soprano,*alto'  | semits -x | ditto -s = | awk
'{if($0~/[^0-9\t-]/)next}{if($1>$2) print NR}'``
extract -i '*alto,*tenor'  | semits -x | ditto -s = | awk
'{if($0~/[^0-9\t-]/)next}{if($1>$2) print NR}'
extract -i '*tenor,*bass'  | semits -x | ditto -s = | awk
'{if($0~/[^0-9\t-]/)next}{if($1>$2) print NR}'


(7) Parts Separated by Greater than an Octave
---------------------------------------------


RULE: "Avoid intervals greater than an octave between the soprano and alto
voices. Also avoid intervals greater than an octave between the alto and
tenor voices."
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::

Finding infringements of this voice-leading rule requires just a slight
modification to our method for identifying the crossing of parts.

Having transformed the pitch input to a numerical form, we simply need to
check whether the difference between the two semitone values is greater than
12 semitones.

The **awk** portion of our command is modified so that we are informed if the
nominally higher voice is more than 12 semitones away from the other voice:

`` extract -i '*soprano,*alto'  | semits -x | ditto -s = | awk
'{if($0~/[^0-9\t-]/)next}{if($2-$1>12) print NR}'
extract -i '*alto,*tenor'  | semits -x | ditto -s = | awk
'{if($0~/[^0-9\t-]/)next}{if($2-$1>12) print NR}'``


(8) Overlapped Parts
--------------------


RULE: "Avoid the overlapping of parts, where the pitch in an ostensibly lower
voice moves to a pitch higher than the previous pitch in an ostensibly higher
voice; or where the pitch in an ostensibly higher voice moves to a pitch
lower than the previous pitch in an ostensibly lower voice."
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The following passage illustrates a violation of the part overlapping rule:



`` **pitch **pitch
> C4 E4
> F4 A4
> E4 G4
> *- *-``

(In the second sonority, the lower voice (F4) moves to a pitch higher than
the previous pitch in the higher voice (E4).)

This rule is similar to the part-crossing rule, only we have to compare the
current pitch in one part with the previous pitch in another part.

Rather than making a direct comparison, for the purpose of this tutorial, we
will make a modification to our earlier part-crossing detector. In brief, we
will extract one of the parts, shift the data tokens within that part, paste
the two parts back together, and then check to determine whether the shifted
part shows any "crossed parts" -- using our earlier command pipeline.

The following command pipe will shift the data tokens in a spine down one
record. (The last data record will disappear.)

`` context -n 2 -p 1 -d XXX  | humsed 's/XXX.*//'``

In this tutorial, we won't discuss how this works, since the **context** and
**humsed** commands will be covered in a future tutorial. For now, we can
note that shifting (say) the alto part can be done by extracting the
appropriate voice, and then using the shift command sequence shown above:

`` extract -i '**alto'  | context -n 2 -p 1 -d XXX | humsed 's/XXX.*//' >
alto.shf``

If we want to compare, say, the soprano and alto voices, we need to extract
both parts, and shift one of them:

`` extract -i '*soprano'  > soprano
extract -i '*alto'  | context -n 2 -p 1 -d XXX | humsed 's/XXX.*//' >
alto.shf``

Next, we need to assemble the shifted and unshifted parts back into a single
score:

`` assemble alto.shf soprano > tempfile``

Then we test this intermediate file for instances of "part-crossing" -- using
our earlier command pipeline:

`` semits -x tempfile | ditto -s = | awk '{if($0~/[^0-9\t-]/)next}{if($1>$2)
print NR}'``

Avoiding the temporary file altogether:

`` assemble alto.shf soprano | semits -x | ditto -s = | awk
'{if($0~/[^0-9\t-]/)next}{if($1>$2) print NR}'``

Note that this procedure has determined whether any of the notes in the
soprano voice are lower than the previous note in the alto voice. We also
need to check whether any of the notes in the alto voice are higher than the
previous note in the soprano voice. To do this, we simply repeat the process,
shifting the other voice:

`` extract -i '*soprano'  | context -n 2 -p 1 -d XXX | humsed 's/XXX.*//' >
soprano.shf
extract -i '*alto'  > alto
assemble alto soprano.shf | semits -x | ditto -s = | awk
'{if($0~/[^0-9\t-]/)next}{if($1>$2) print NR}'``

This processing needs to be applied for each pair of successive voices --
soprano/alto, alto/tenor, tenor/bass.


(9) Exposed Octaves
-------------------


RULE: "When approaching an octave by similar motion, ensure that at least one
of the parts moves by step."
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Violations of the exposed octaves rules must meet three conditions. First,
the two voices must be separated by an octave (or two octaves, or a unison,
etc.). (This suggests that we use the **hint** command with the **-c** option
in order to reduce compound intervals to their non-compound equivalents.)
Second, the voices must be moving in the same direction. (The ``**deg``
representation may be suitable here, since it distinguishes notes according
to whether they are approached from below ("^") or above ("v").) Third, both
voices must be moving by leap (e.g. more than two semitones).

To address this problem, let's plan to create five different spines. The
first spine will encode harmonic interval size so that all compound
equivalents to a unison are represented by the string "P1".

The second spine will indicate whether the lower voice is ascending or
descending ("^" or "v"). Similarly, the third spine will indicate whether the
upper voices is ascending or descending.

The fourth spine will indicate whether the melodic motion for the lower voice
is by leap ("leap"), and the fifth spine will indicate whether the melodic
motion for the upper voice is by leap.

Examples of violations of the exposed octaves rule will appear as one of the
following two situations:



`` (**hint **updown **updown **size **size)
> P1 ^ ^ leap leap
> P1 v v leap leap

Any other situation means that the exposed octaves rule has not been
violated.

In other words, our final test can be expressed using the following **egrep**
command:

`` egrep -n 'P1.*^.*^.*leap.*leap|P1.*v.*v.*leap.*leap'``

Now all we need to do is generate our five spines and assemble them in the
proper order.

The first spine is easily generated using the **hint** command. Remember that
the **-c** option means that all intervals an octave or greater will be
represented by the within-octave equivalent.

`` extract -i '*alto,*tenor'  | hint -c > spine1``

The second and third spines can be generated using the Humdrum `**deg**`_
command:

`` extract -i '*alto'  | deg > spine2
extract -i '*tenor'  | deg > spine3``

The fourth and fifth spines require a little more work. First, we calculate
the melodic intervals for each voice using the Humdrum `**mint**`_ command.

`` extract -i '*alto'  | mint ...``

Secondly, we need to change all data tokens indicating intervals greater than
a diatonic second (3 or more semitones) into the data token consisting of the
(arbitrary) character string "leap". This can be done using the `**humsed**`_
stream editor.

``  ... humsed 's/.*[3-9].*/leap/' > spine4 [spine5 for the other voice]``

Putting it all together, the following command sequence will let us identify
any instances of exposed octaves between two arbitrary voices:

`` extract -i '*alto,*tenor'  | hint -c > spine1
extract -i '*alto'  | deg > spine2
extract -i '*tenor'  | deg > spine3
extract -i '*alto'  | mint | humsed 's/.*[3-9].*/leap/' > spine4
extract -i '*tenor'  | mint | humsed 's/.*[3-9].*/leap/' > spine5
assemble spine1 spine2 spine3 spine4 spine5 > tempfile
egrep -n 'P1.*^.*^.*leap.*leap|P1.*v.*v.*leap.*leap' tempfile``
