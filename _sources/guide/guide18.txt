Fingers, Footsteps and Frets
-----------------------------------

Throughout this book, our examples have tended to rely on just a handful of
Humdrum representations -- ``**kern`` in particular. Of course the Humdrum
syntax provides opportunities for an unlimited number of representations. In
this chapter, we will consider some less common representations. Most of the
chapter will deal with the ```**fret```_ representation -- a pre-defined
Humdrum representation for fretted instrument tablatures. However, we will
begin with a grab-bag of unorthodox representations.


Heart Beats and Other Esoterica
-------------------------------

The Humdrum syntax provides a framework within which different symbol systems
can be defined. Each symbol system or representation scheme is denoted by a
unique exclusive interpretation. There is no restriction on the number of
schemes that can be used or created by the user. Each time you create a new
exclusive interpretation, all of the alphanumeric characters can be
redefined. A representation scheme springs into existence simply by encoding
some data.

In research activities, it is common to create representation schemes for a
specific task. A user might define a spine that represents the heart-rate (in
beats per minute) of a music listener:

`` **cardio
`` 76
`` 76
`` 74
`` 73
`` 73
`` *-``

A scheme might be created to represent different types of contrapuntal
motion:

`` **motion
`` similar
`` contrary
`` parallel
`` oblique
`` *-``

Chords might be classified -- using words:

`` **chords
`` minor
`` .
`` augmented
`` major
`` *-``

Or using abbreviations:

`` **chords
`` m
`` .
`` A
`` M
`` *-``

Fingerings might be represented. Each hand may have a separate spine:

`` **finger**finger
`` *left*right
`` .1
`` 1 52
`` .3
`` .5
`` 1 52 5
`` *-*-``

Or the hands might be combined in a single spine:

`` **finger
`` R1
`` L1 L5 R2
`` R3
`` 5
`` L1 L5 R2 R5
`` *-``

Time-scales might be large:

`` **Periods
`` Medieval
`` Renaissance
`` Baroque
`` Classical
`` Romantic
`` *-``

Or miniscule:

`` **milliseconds
`` 0.03
`` 0.8
`` 23.2
`` 31.6
`` *-``

A user might define a highly refined special-purpose representation. For
example, the following scheme is fashioned after the Benesh dance notation:

`` !! Kellom Tomlinson's``Gavot of 1720.
`` !! Transcribed from``Feuillet's notation.
`` **kern``**Benesh
`` *MM120``*MM120
`` *M2/2``*M2
`` *e:``*
`` !! First Couplet
`` !``! Half Coupee
`` 4.gg`` | |u| | |
`` .``%|+| | | |
`` .`` |=|v| | |
`` .``(| | | | |
`` .``(|-| | | |{
`` 8ff#`` |_| | | |2
`` =1``-----------
`` 2ee``m| | | | |}
`` !``! Bound
`` .``_|^| | | |{
`` .``(|+| | | |
`` 4.b``-| | | | |
`` .``(|+| | | |}
`` .``_| | | | |{
`` 8a``_|+|+| | |
`` =2``-----------
`` !``! Bouree
`` 4g`` | | | | |
`` .`` |=| | | |
`` 4e`` |=| | | |}
`` .``_|=| | | |
`` 4g`` |o| | | |
`` !``! Bouree
`` 4a``_|+|+| | |
`` =3``-----------
`` *-``*-``

Depending on the task, user-defined schemes can be either carefully designed,
or "throw-away" concoctions created for momentary purposes. The *Humdrum
Reference Manual* provides detailed advice on how to go about designing
special-purpose Humdrum representations.

For the remainder of this chapter we will examine a pre-defined
representation scheme for fretted instrument tablatures. Although not all
users will be interested in the ``**fret`` representation, it provides an
instructive contrast to the score- and MIDI-based representations that we
have relied on for most of the examples in this book.


The ***fret* Representation
---------------

The ```**fret```_ representation is a pre-defined Humdrum scheme that
provides a comprehensive system for representing performance aspects for
fretted instruments. The ``**fret`` scheme is suitable for representing
tablature information for most fretted instruments, such as various guitars,
lute, mandore, theorbo, chitarrone, mandoline, banjo, dulcimer, and even
viols. The ``**fret`` interpretation is not limited to equal-temperament
tuning, and so can be used to represent non-Western fretted instruments, such
as the *oud* and the *sitar*.

The ``**fret`` representation is performance-oriented rather than
notationally-oriented. Thus ``**fret`` is not suitable for distinguishing
different visual renderings -- such as differences between traditional French
or German lute tablatures. Some other Humdrum representation should be used
if the user's goal is to distinguish different forms of visual signifiers.

The basic pitches produced by fretted instruments depend on three factors:
(1) the relative tuning of the strings with respect to each other, (2) the
absolute overall tuning of the instrument, and (3) the position of the frets.
Three tandem interpretations allow the user to specify each of these aspects.

The absolute tuning of an instrument is indicated by encoding the pitch of
the lowest string using the ``*AT:`` tandem interpretation. For the common
six-string guitar, the lowest pitch is normally tuned to E2, and so would be
encoded with the following tandem interpretation:

`` *AT:E2``

The ``*AT:`` interpretation makes use of ```**pitch```_-type pitch
designations and may also include cents deviation. For example, an instrument
tuned 45 cents sharp might be represented as ``*AT:E2+45``. Encoding the
absolute tuning is optional with ```**fret```_; when absent, a default tuning
of E2 will be assumed by various processing tools.

A second tandem interpretation (``*RT:``) specifies the relative tuning as
well as the number and arrangement of strings. Some instruments pair strings
together in close physical proximity so that two strings are treated by the
performer as a single virtual "string." Such paired strings are referred to
as *courses.* For example, the 12-string guitar is constructed using 6
courses, and is played much like a 6-string guitar -- except that two strings
sound together, rather than a single string.

The ``*RT:`` tandem interpretation encodes the relative tuning of each string
by specifying the number of semitones above the lowest string -- where each
course is delineated by a colon (:). In Example 18.1 three sample tunings are
shown. Example (a) defines the most common relative tuning for the six-string
guitar. Successive strings are tuned 0, 5, 10, 15, 19, and 24 semitones above
the lowest string.

**Example 18.1. Sample Tunings for Fretted Instruments.**

(a) Common 6-string guitar.

> .. image:: guide.figures/guide18.1a.gif


`` *AT:E2``
`` *RT:0:5:10:15:19:24``

(b) Common 12-string guitar.

`` *AT:E2``
`` *RT:0,12:5,17:10,22:15,27:19,19:24,24``

(c) Vieil accord lute.

> .. image:: guide.figures/guide18.1c.gif

`` *AT:G2``
`` *RT:0,12:5,17:10,22:14,14:19,19:24,24``

Example (b) defines the most common relative tuning for the 12-string guitar.
The six courses are delineated by colons and the tuning of strings withint
courses are delineated by commas. In this case, the lower four courses
consists of two strings tuned an octave apart, whereas the upper two courses
consist of paired unison strings.

Example (c) shows the most common tuning of the 6-course *lute* -- a tuning
referred to as the so-called *vieil accord*: G2, C3, F3, A3, D4, and G4.
During the first half of the 16th century, it was common to tune the lower
three courses in octaves.

For non-Western and other instruments, it is possible to encode non-integer
semitone values for various strings, such as a string tuned 9.91 semitones
above the lowest string.

In addition to the absolute and relative tunings, ```**fret```_ also allows
the user to specify the tuning of successive frets using the ``FT:`` tandem
interpretation. In Western instruments, frets are normally placed in semitone
increments. For a 12-fret instrument, this semitone arrangement may be
explicitly represented using the following tandem interpretation:

`` *FT:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12``

Each successive numerical value indicates the number of semitones above the
open string for successive fret positions. The interpretation begins with the
tuning of the first fret rather than the tuning of the open string. The above
interpretation is similar to the *default fret tuning* -- which is an
increase of precisely one-- itone for each successive fret. The default fret
tuning is not limited to 12 frets as in the above example. An instrument
constructed with nine 1/4-tone fret positions can be encoded as follows:

`` *FT:.5,1,1.5,2,2.5,3,3.5,4,4.5``

The only restriction imposed by ``*FT:`` is that all strings must have
identical fret distances. That is, if the first fret is positioned 1 semitone
above the open string, then this relative pitch arrangement must be true of
all strings.

The ```**fret```_ representation distinguishes three types of data tokens:
tablature-tokens, rests, and barlines. *Tablature-tokens* encode information
regarding the fret/finger positions, the manner by which individual strings
are plucked (or bowed), pitch-bending, vibrato, damping, harmonics, and other
effects. The actions of individual fingers can also be represented. Each
tablature-token consists of a several subtokens in the form of Humdrum
multiple-stops. Subtokens are delimited by spaces and represent individual
courses/strings. A six-string (or six-course) instrument will require six
subtokens in each tablature-token. For example, the following tablature token
encodes the plucking of the first and sixth string:

`` | - - - - |``

Subtokens consist of up to five component elements: (1) the string/course
status, (2) fret position, (3) bowing/strumming, (4) finger action, and (5)
percussive effects. In addition, the tablature-token can encode bowing and
strumming information.

In the ```**fret```_ representation, the status of a string/course can occupy
one of sixteen states. An *inactive* string is signified by th-nus sign
(``-``). An ordinary *plucked* string is represented by the vertical line
(``|``). Plucking near the bridge (*plucked ponticello*) is represented by
the slash character (``/``). Plucking near the tone-hole (*plucked sul
tasto*) is represented by the backslash character (``\``). The repeated
*plucked-tremolo* (commonly used on the mandoline) is represented using the
octothorpe or hash character (``#``). *Pizzicato* is represented by the small
letter ```z``'. Normal bowing of a string is represented by the plus sign
(``+``); *ponticello* bowing is represented by the open parenthesis ```(``'
whereas *sul tasto* bowing is represented by the closed parenthesis ```)``'.
*Spiccato* (bouncing the bow) is represented by the open curly brace ```{``'.
*Col legno* (using the wood of the bow) is represented by the closed curly
brace '``}``'. *Tremolo bowing* is represented by the ampersand (``&``).
*Natural harmonics* and *artificial harmonics* are represented by the lower-
case ```o``' and upper-case ```O``' respectively. String *ringing* is denoted
by the colon (``:``), and the *damping* of a string is denoted by the small
letter ```x``'.

By way of illustration, the following tablature-token represents a six-string
or six-course instrument, where the first through sixth strings are
respectively (1 and 2) plucked, (3) damped, (4) bowed, (5) plucked sul tasto,
(6) inactive.

`` | | x + \ -``

Note that the layout of the strings in a tablature-token always corresponds
to the tuning specified in the relative-tuning interpretation. In most
representations, the lower-pitched strings will be toward the left side of
the tablature token.

*Fret-position* information is indicated through the use of numbers, with the
first fret signified by the number `1'. Fret-position numbers are encoded
immediately to the right of their respective string/course. For example, the
following tablature-token encodes a six-string/course instrument in which the
second and third strings are both stopped at the second fret.

`` | |2 |2 | | |``

Example 18.2 shows a sample passage for guitar with a corresponding
`` **fret`` representation displayed beneath. The ``**fret`` representation
does not encode duration information. It is common to join the ``**fret``
spine with a ```**recip```_ spine representing the nominal duration data. In
example 18.2 a ```**kern```_ spine is also shown indicating the pitches in
the ``**fret`` representation.

`` 8``b``- : : : : |4
`` =4``=4``=4
`` 2``E e cc``- |4 : : : |5v
`` *-``*-``*-``

The ``**fret`` representation also provides several short-hand abbreviations
for common ornaments and effects. Trills are indicated by the letters `t'
(one semitone) and `T' (two semitones). Mordents are indicated by the letters
`m' (one semitone) and `D' (two semitones). Inverted mordents are indicated
by the letters `w' (one semitone) and `W' (two semitones). Turns are
indicated by the letters `S' and `$' (for the inverted "Wagnerian" turn). Two
types of vibrato are distinguished: `v' for transverse vibrato and `V' for
lateral vibrato. Pitch bending is signified by the tilde (~).

Apart from tablature-tokens, ``**fret`` also permits the encoding of rests
and barlines. Rests tokens are denoted simply by the lower-case letter `r'.
Barlines are represented using the "common system" for barlines used by
`` **kern`` and other representations.


Additional Features of ***fret*
------

*Bowing-direction* and *strumming* information is prepended to the beginning
of the tablature-token. The direction of bowing/strumming is encoded using
the left and right angle brackets: ``>`` means to bow/strum from the strings
on the left side of the representation toward the strings on the right side
of the representation. (On most instruments this means strumming "downward"
-- from the lowest- to the highest-pitched strings.) The left angle bracket:
`` <`` means to strum in the opposite direction. A rough indication of the
speed of bowing/strumming can be represented by duplicating these signifiers.
For example, ``>>`` means a slower "downward" bow/strum, and ``<<<`` means an
especially slow "upward" bow/strum. The percent sign (%) is used to signify
the so-called *rasgueado* -- or flamboyant Spanish strum. Once again these
signifiers appear at the beginning of a tablature-token -- whenever they are
encoded. Strumming all 6 open strings downward on a commonly-tuned guitar is
represented as:

`` *AT:E2
*RT:0:5:10:15:19:24
>| | | | | |``

Notice that there is no space between the right angle bracket and the first
vertical bar.

The ```**fret```_ representation also permits the optional encoding of
*fingering* information. For the plucking-hand (normally right hand),
traditional musical abbreviations are used: *P* (pollex) for the thumb, *I*
(index) for the index finger, *M* (medius) for the middle finger, *A*
(annularis) for the ring finger, and *Q* (quintus) for the little finger. In
addition, the lower-case letter *p* is used to signify the palm of the hand.
Note that these letters are applied only to the `plucking' hand. In the case
of the `fret-board' hand, the lower-case letters *a-e* are used to denote the
thumb, index finger, middle finger, ring finger, and little fingers,
respectively. Like the fret information, fingering information is encoded
immediately to the right of the string to which the information applies. By
way of illustration, the finger actions used in the above example may be made
explicit as follows:

`` >|P |2bP |2cP |P |P |P``

The strum is carried out by the thumb, while the index and middle fingers of
the fret-hand stop the second and third courses/strings at the second fret.
In the following continuation of this representation, the first course/string
is replucked by the thumb. With the exception of the second and third
courses/strings, the other strings are allows to ring.

`` >|P |2bP |2cP |P |P |P
>|P xIM xIM : : :``

Notice that in damping the vibrations of the second and third strings, both
the index and middle fingers of the `pluck' hand are used on both strings.

On rare occasions, guitarists will substitute fingers on the fret-board while
a string remains sounding. The following example illustrates such a finger-
substitution where the middle finger is replaced by the ring finger:

`` | |2b |2c | | |
: :2b :2d : : :``

Note that in the ``**fret`` representation, no special signifiers are
provided for so-called `hammer-on' or (ascending-slur), nor for the so-called
`pull-off' or (descending-slur). During the ascending-slur, the sound is
produced simply by engaging the next fret. This can be represented in
`` **fret`` by using the "let ring" signifier (:) in conjunction with the
appropriate fret notation. The descending-slur can be similarly notated.

Four types of "percussion effects" can be represented using ``**fret``. The
two most common *tambours* involve tapping on the bridge (represented by the
lower-case letter `u') and tapping on the strings near the bridge
(represented by the upper-case letter `U'). A simple `tap' on the top-plate
is represented by the lower-case letter `y', whereas a lower-pitched `thump'
on the top-plate is represented by the upper-case letter `Y'. When sounded
alone, these signifiers appear on a line by themselves. When sounded in
conjunction with a plucked or (uncommonly) bowed string, these signifiers
appear at the beginning of the tablature-token.

The complete system of signifiers used by ```**fret```_ is summarized in
Table 18.1.

*Summary of ***fret* Signifiers*

A number of pitch-related Humdrum commands accept ``**fret`` encoded data as
inputs, including `**cents**,`_ `**freq**,`_ `**kern**,`_ `**pitch**,`_
`**semits**,`_ `**solfg**,`_ and `**tonh**.`_

Reprise
-------

In this chapter we have tried to reinforce the lesson that ```**kern```_ is
only one of an unbounded number of existing and possible Humdrum
representations. As a Humdrum user, you are free to concoct your own
representations to better address the kinds of information you are interested
in manipulating. As long as the resulting representation conforms to the
Humdrum syntax, the most important Humdrum tools can still be used to
manipulate your data.
