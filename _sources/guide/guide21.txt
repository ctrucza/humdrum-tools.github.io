Searching for Patterns
======================

--------

The **grep** and **egrep** commands are useful for identifying patterns that
occur on single lines. As we saw in `Chapter 19,`_ the `**context**`_ command
can be used to amalgamate groups of successive data tokens on a single line
-- and so facilitate searching for sequential patterns using **grep** or
**egrep**. For many tasks, the combination of **context** and **grep**
provides the most convenient way to search for user-specified patterns.
However, not all patterns can be conveniently identified using this approach.
In this chapter we will introduce two additional tools that are intended to
search directly for sequential patterns without having to use **context** to
create pseudo-simultaneous collections.


The *patt* Command
--------

The `**patt**`_ command may be regarded as a two-dimensional version of
**grep**. Like **grep**, **patt** searches for lines that match user-
specified regular expressions. However, unlike **grep**, **patt** can search
for a sequence of records that match a sequence of user-specified regular
expressions. Specifically, **patt** will look for an input line that matches
the first (of potential many) user-specified regular expression. Then
**patt** will determine whether the following input line matches the second
user-specified regular expression ... and so on, until the entire sequence of
the user-specified regular expressions are exhausted. A pattern match is
deemed to occur only if all of the successive regular expressions match a
contiguous sequence of input lines.

The operation of **patt** is easier to describe through an example. Consider
the following input using the German *Tonhohe* pitch designations described
in `Chapter 4.`_ Recall that the ```**Tonh```_ system of pitch names allows
Bach to spell his name (B=B-flat; H=B-natural). Less well-known is the fact
that Dmitri Shostakovich also used the German pitch system to create motives
based on his name: D-S-C-H (S=Es=E-flat). (The German transliteration of the
cyrillic is Schostakowitsch.)

`` **Tonh
`` D4
`` Es4
`` C4
`` H3
`` *-``

Suppose we were looking for possible instances of D-S-C-H. The **patt**
command requires a template file that contains one or more successive regular
expressions. A suitable template file (named ``dmitri``) would be as follows:

`` D
`` Es
`` C
`` H``

We would invoke the search as follows:

`` patt -f dmitri`` *inputfile*

The **-f** option is mandatory: it conveys to **patt** the name of the
template file used in the search.

In the default operation, **patt** simply outputs a global comment
identifying the location of any matching segments. One global comment is
output for each matching pattern. In the above case, the output would be as
follows:

`` !! Pattern found at line 2 of file Tonh``

The `**patt**`_ command will also identify any overlapping patterns. For
example, suppose we had an input containing an ostinato figure in minor
thirds:

**Example 21.1.** `DSCH' Ostinato.

> .. image:: guide.figures/guide21.1.gif

>
>``**Tonh**Tonh
>``*k[b-e-]*K[b-e-]
>``*M9/8*M9/8
>``=1-=1-
>``C4Es4
>``C4Es4
>``H3D4
>``C4Es4
>``C4Es4
>``H3D4
>``C4Es4
>``C4Es4
>``H3D4
>``==``

If we applied the above **patt** command to this ``ostinato`` file, we would
get the following output:

`` !! Pattern found at line 8 of file ostinato``
`` !! Pattern found at line 11 of file ostinato``

We can instruct **patt** to output specific instances of the pattern using
the **-e** (echo) option. Consider the following command:

`` patt -f dmitri -e ostinato``

The resulting output would be:

`` !! Pattern found at line 4 of file ostinato
`` **Tonh``**Tonh
`` H3``D4
`` C4``Es4
`` C4``Es4
`` H3``D4
`` *-``*-
`` !! Pattern found at line 7 of file ostinato
`` **Tonh``**Tonh
`` H3``D4
`` C4``Es4
`` C4``Es4
`` H3``D4
`` *-``*-``

Notice that each instance of the found pattern is output as a stand-alone
humdrum "mini-encoding," complete with initial exclusive interpretations and
terminating spine-path terminators.

**Example 21.2.** J.S. Bach, *Well-Tempered Clavier*, Vol. 1, Fugue 2.

> .. image:: guide.figures/guide21.2.gif


Most Baroque composers were fond of ending works written in minor keys on the
tonic major chord -- the so-called *tierce de picardie* or Picardy Third.
Example 21.2 shows a typical example from the final measures of Bach's second
fugue from the *Well-Tempered Clavier*, vol. 1. Suppose that we wanted to
identify all works in some repertory that end with a *tierce de picardie*. We
need to search for a raised third scale degree in close proximity to the end
of a work for those works in a minor key. First we might identify those works
in minor keys. The following **grep** command will search all files in the
current directory for a tandem interpretation indicating a minor key. Recall
that minor keys are identified by an asterisk followed by a lower-case pitch-
letter name, followed by an optional accidental, followed by the colon
character. The **-l** option will list all files that containing a matching
record:

`` grep -l '^\*[a-g][-#]*:' *``

Recall that the `**deg**`_ command is mode sensitive, whereas the
`**solfa**`_ command is mode insensitive. That is, in the key of C major,
**deg** will represent the pitch E as ``3`` and in C minor **deg** will
represent the pitch E (natural) as ``3+``. By contrast, the **solfa** command
will represent E as ```mi``' whether the mode is major or minor.

In order to locate picardy thirds, we can look for raised mediants in the
`` **deg`` representation. Specifically, we can look for a raised mediant
pitch immediately prior to a double barline. Our template file (dubbed
"``picardy``") might look as follows:

`` 3[+]
==``

Notice that the plus sign has been placed in square brackets. The **patt**
command accepts only *extended* regular expressions. The plus sign is a
metacharacter that normally indicates "one or more instances." So placing it
in square brackets causes the special meaning to be escaped.

In order to search for such picardy thirds, we should translate each input
file to the ``**deg`` representation, and then search for raised mediants
immediately prior to a double bar:

`` deg *inputfile.krn* | patt -f picardy``

A problem with this search strategy is that it assumes that the raised third
will occur in the final sonority prior to the double barline. One possible
confound might be the presence of one or more rests following the final
chord. This situation is evident in Fugue No. 4 from the second volume of
Bach's *Well-Tempered Clavier*:

**Example 21.3.** J.S. Bach, *Well-Tempered Clavier*, Vol. 2, Fugue 4.

The **patt** command provides a **-s** option that allows the user to skip or
ignore certain records in the input. Any regular expression can be given as a
parameter for the **-s** option. In the following pipeline, we have
instruction **patt** to skip over any records matching the lower-case letter
`` `r``' (the ``**kern`` rest signifier):

`` deg ``*inputfile.krn*`` | patt -s r -f picardy``

Even ignoring rests may not be sufficient to identify the raised third near
the double barline. For example, if any other note from the tonic chord
follows after the raised third, then the third will appear several records
prior to the double barline. We can solve this problem by using the
`**ditto**`_ command discussed in `Chapter 15;`_ **ditto** can be used to
propagate the raised third through the sustained final chord. Our revised
pipeline is:

`` deg bach.krn | ditto -s = | patt -s r -f picardy``

A similar approach can be used to identify consecutive fifths or octaves
between two voices. A template file (dubbed ``5ths``) might consist of the
following pattern:

`` P5
P5``

In order to identify consecutive fifths, we might extract two parts of
interest, and then translate to the ```**hint```_ harmonic-interval
representation. The **-c** option for `**hint**`_ collapses compound
intervals to their non-compound equivalents so consecutive twelfths,
nineteenths, etc. will also be identified. In the following command pipeline,
notice the use of the **-s** option for `**patt**`_ in order to skip
barlines. This ensures that crossing a barline does not result in a failure
to identify a consecutive fifth.

`` extract -i '*Ibass,*Itenor' Fux | hint -c | patt -s = -f 5ths``

Sometimes patterns will tend to be obscured by the presence of other
information. For example, suppose we want to identify possible Landini
cadences such as the cadence shown in Example 21.4. Landini cadences are
common in much 14th century polyphony including works by Machaut, Caserta,
Dufay, Ciconia, as well as Landini. One characteristic of the Landini cadence
is the distinctive three-note *ti -> la -> do* in the upper-most part. The
submediant pitch is interposed between the leading-tone and the tonic. A
second characteristic of the Landini cadence is the harmonic relationship
between the highest and lowest voices. Three intervals are formed: *sixth ->
fifth -> octave*. Either one or both of these characteristics might be used
to help identify this distinctive cadential formula.

**Example 21.4.** Francesco Landini, Excerpt from *Non avra ma' pieta*.

> .. image:: guide.figures/guide21.4.gif


Below is a ```**kern```_ encoding of the final two measures along with
corresponding ```**hint```_ and ```**deg```_ spines. The **hint spine was
generated using `**hint**`_ **-l** in order to generate intervals with
respect to the lowest pitch.

`` *-``*-``*-``*-*-*-*-``

Notice that **hint** has failed to generate the passing interval forming the
perfect fifth between the E and the A. This can be remedied by using
**ditto** to duplicate all of the pitches. This will cause **hint** to
generate all of the passing harmonic intervals. The revised **hint spine is
given below.

`` *-*-*-*-*-*-*-``

One way to identify Landini cadences is to use the following harmonic-
interval template file (dubbed ``LandCadence``):

`` 6
`` 5
`` 8``

Using this template, we can identify Landini cadences as follows. (Notice the
use of **-s ^=** to skip barlines.)

`` ditto -s ^= input | hint -l | patt -s ^= -f LandCadence``

It is possible that the 6-5-8 figured bass might arise in non-cadential
situations, so a more circumspect template might also include some scale-
degree movements as well. The following template file (dubbed ``Landini-
Cadence``) combines both the harmonic-interval and scale-degree data:

`` [Mm]6
P5.*v6
P8.*\^1``

Using this more sophisticated pattern template, a suitable sequence of
commands would be the following:

`` ditto -s ^= inputfile | hint -l > temp1
deg inputfile > temp2
assemble temp1 temp2 | patt -s ^= -f Landini-Cadence``

In general, **patt** templates can be used to specify both concurrent
conditions as well as dynamic or temporal conditions. This allows users to
define patterns involving a multitude of conditions involving many different
types of data.


Using *patt*'s Tag Option
-------------

So far, we have seen that `**patt**`_ provides two kinds of output. In the
default operation, **patt** outputs a simple global comment each time it
finds a matching segment in the input. With the **-e** option, **patt** will
also echo the specific passage(s) found. In addition, **patt** provides a
third type of output using the **-t** option.

When the **-t** option is invoked, **patt** will output the original input,
plus an addition ``**patt`` spine. The ``**patt`` spine typically consists of
mostly null tokens. However, each time the input matches the sought pattern,
a user-defined "tag" will appear in the ``**patt`` spine. Consider the
following example.

Suppose we are interested in identifying deceptive cadences in Bach's chorale
harmonizations. Imagine that we already have a ```**harm```_ spine containing
a Roman numeral harmonic analysis. There are different ways of defining a
deceptive cadence, but a frequent definition is that it involves a dominant
chord followed by a submediant chord in a cadential context. In the case of
Bach's chorale harmonizations, cadences are readily identified by the pause
symbol. Our search template might look as follows:

`` ^V([^I]|$)
(vi)|(VI);``

This template means: "look for an upper-case letter ``V`` appearing at the
beginning of a line that is followed by either the end of the line (````) or
by a character other than the upper-case letter ``I``. This record will be
followed by a record containing either ``vi`` or ``VI`` followed by a
semicolon."

When invoking the **patt** command, we can specify our preferred output tag
along with the **-t** option as follows:

`` extract -i '**harm' bwv269.krn | patt -f template -t deceptive``

`` **harm**patt
`` I.
`` I.
`` ii7.
`` Vdeceptive
`` vi;.
`` V.
`` I.
`` IV.
`` IV.
`` I.
`` V;.``
> etc.

 In `Chapter 26`_ we will learn how to collapse several spines into a single
 spine. This will allow us to assemble the results from several "passes"
 using **patt** -- one pass for each type of cadence. For example, we could
 collapse several tagged outputs to produce a single spine that identifies
 all of the various types of cadences:

`` **harm**cadences
I.
I.
ii7.
Vdeceptive
vi;.
V.
I.
IV.
IV.
Ihalf
V;.``
etc.

 There are no restrictions as to the types of tags that can be generated by
 **patt**. A user might tag the beginning of motivic or thematic statements,
 various harmonic progressions, variation techniques, fingering patterns,
 quotations or allusions, stylistic cliches, etc. In `Chapter 35`_ we will
 use the **-t** option to label different set forms for statements of a
 twelve-tone row, such as primes, inversions, retrogrades, and retrograde
 inversions. We will use suitable tags to identify the specific
 transpositions: P0, I7, R11, RI8, etc.


Matching Multiple Records Using the *patt* Command
--------

 Twelve-tone music raises several special issues for sequential pattern
 matching. For example, it is common in serial music to collapse segments of
 a tone-row in order to create vertical chords. Consider the following
 excerpt from Ernst Krenek's suite for solo 'cello. The tone row consists of
 the ordered pitches: D, G-flat, F, D-flat, C, B, E-flat, A, B-flat, A-flat,
 E, G.

**Example 21.5.** Ernst Krenek, Opus 84 *Suite for Violoncello*; mov. 1,
measures 28-30.

> .. image:: guide.figures/guide21.5.gif


 Using a pitch-class representation we would search for the sequence:

`` 2
6
5
1
0
11
3
9
10
8
4
7``

 Due to the diads, however, the corresponding pitch-class representation for
 the above Krenek passage would be:

`` **pc
2
6
5 1
0
=
3 11
9
10
10 8
=
7 4``
etc.
`` *-``

 The **-m** option for `**patt**`_ invokes a "multi-record matching" mode.
 In this mode, **patt** attempts to match as many successive regular
 expressions in the template file as possible for a given input record,
 before continuing with the next input and template records. In this way,
 several records in the template file may possibly match a single input
 record. In the above case, the tone-row template will be matched and the
 `P0' tag issued if the following command is issued:

`` patt -f tonerow -t P0 -m Krenek``


The *pattern* Command
--------

 Not all patterns can be identified using **patt**. The Humdrum
 `**pattern**`_ command permits an additional regular expression feature that
 is especially useful in musical applications. Specifically, **pattern**
 permits the defining of patterns spanning more than one line or record.
 Record-repetition operators are specified by following the regular
 expression with a tab -- followed by either ``+``, ``*``, or ``?``. For
 example, consider the following Humdrum-extension regular expression:

`` X+
Y*
Z?``

 When the metacharacters ``+``, ``*``, or ``?`` appear at the end of a
 record, preceded by a tab character, they pertain to the number of records,
 rather than the number of repetitions of the expression within a record. The
 first record of the regular expression (``X``**``+``) will match one or more
 successive lines each containing the letter ```X``'. The second record of
 the regular expression (``Y``**``*``) will match zero or more subsequent
 lines containing the letter ```Y``'. The third record of the regular
 expression (``Z``**``?``) will match zero or one line containing the letter
 ```Z``'. Hence, the above multi-record regular expression would match an
 input such as the following: three successive lines containing the letter
 ```X``', followed by eight successive lines containing the letter ```Y``',
 followed by a single line containing the letter ```Z``'. Similarly, the
 above regular expression would match an input containing one line containing
 the letter ```X``'.

 Record-repetition operators can be used in conjunction with all of the
 other regular expression features. For example, the following regular
 expression matches one or more successive ```**kern```_ data records
 containing the pitch ```G``' (naturals only) followed optionally by a single
 ```G#``' followed by one or more records containing one or more pitches from
 an A major triad -- the last of which must end a phrase:

 ``

> [Gg]+[^#-] +
[Gg]+#[^#] ?
([Aa]+|([Cc]+#)|[Ee]+)[^#-] *
(}.*([Aa]+|([Cc]+#)|[Ee]+)[^#-]))|(([Aa]+|([Cc]+#)|[Ee]+)[^#-].*})

 ``


Patterns of Patterns
--------------------

 Music often exhibits hierarchical structures where particular types of
 patterns may be embedded in other patterns, or where low-level patterns join
 together to form higher-level patterns. As we have seen, the **-t** (tag)
 option for the **patt** command allows a new output spine to be generated.
 This spine contains user-defined labels marking the beginning of each found
 pattern. The labels can contain any user-defined text string such as
 ``authentic cadence``, ``episode``, ``Motive 3b``, ``augmentation``,
 ``triplet figuration``, or ``prolongation``.

 As we will see in `Chapter 26,`_ the contents of several spines can be
 amalgamated to form a single spine. This means that the results for several
 independent pattern searches can be assembled into a single "pattern" spine.
 Several pattern spines may be created that related to patterns found at
 different hierarchical levels, or patterns found using different search
 methods. Of course, these pattern-spines themselves can be used as input to
 further pattern searches thus providing unbounded possibilities for
 searching for patterns of patterns.

 Consider, for example, the following template for the `**pattern**`_
 command:

`` Theme 1 (tonic)+
Bridge*
Theme 2 (tonic)+
Coda?``

 The template reads "one or more instances of ``Theme 1 (tonic)``, followed
 by zero or more instances of ``Bridge``, followed by one or more instances
 of ``Theme 2 (tonic)``, followed by zero or one instance of ``Coda``." This
 template might be used by **pattern** to identify a Recapitulation. Together
 with outputs from parallel searches for `Exposition' and `Development' the
 results of a `Recapitulation' search might similarly be amalgamated and used
 as an input for a higher level search for works exhibiting a sonata-allegro
 structure.

Reprise
-------

 In this chapter and previous chapters we have identified several search-
 related tools, including the UNIX **grep** and **egrep** commands as well as
 the Humdrum `**patt**`_ and `**pattern**`_ commands. Each of these tools has
 different strengths and weaknesses and it is not always clear which tool is
 best for a given task. When searching, don't forget to consider how
 `**context**`_, `**humsed**`_, `**rid**`_ and other tools might facilitate
 the searching task. In future chapters will will consider how "similarity"
 tools such as `**correl**`_ and `**simil**`_ can contribute to more
 sophisticated pattern searches.
