Chapter 37: Electronic Music Editing
========================================

The preparation of encoded musical materials for processing is an essential
part of computer-assisted musicology. Without electronic data to process,
none of the manipulations described in this book would be possible. The
encoding and editing of musical data has been an activity that has occupied
various scholars since the earliest forays into computer-assisted musicology
(e.g., Bronson, 1959).

In this chapter we identify and describe some of the tasks and issues
involved in preparing electronic musical documents in the Humdrum format. In
general, the following discussion pertains to the production of electronic
documents representing musical score information. However, the basic
procedures are applicable to any kind of data -- from sound recordings to
historical choreographies of ballets.


The Process of Electronic Editing
---------------------------------

Electronic editing entails translating one representation into another
representation. In many cases, an electronic edition is prepared from
existing source documents -- such as printed scores or manuscripts. In other
cases, an electronic edition may be prepared from another electronic form --
such as MIDI. When translating between two formats, it is important to be
familiar with both representations. Descriptions of a number of popular
electronic music formats may be found in Eleanor Selfridge-Field's
encyclopedic `*Handbook of Musical Codes*`_ (1997).

The principal processes involved in electronic editing include identifying
possible sources and alternative versions, selecting and encoding the
material, proofing the material (using both automated and manual methods),
adding reference and editorial information, writing appropriate research
notes, generating possible analytic information, and resolving issues related
to copyright, distribution, and data integrity.


Establishing the Goal
---------------------

Encoding and editing music is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process.
Before starting to work on a electronic edition, it is appropriate to ask:
what is the goal? What purpose will be served by the edition? Is the
objective to provide a performance copy? A historically accurate document? A
document suitable for analysis? If so, what sort of analysis?

In general, it is wise to avoid trying to cater to all needs at once. There
is nothing wrong with creating a narrowly-defined document that serves a
modest goal. For example, if our intention is to pursue a study of rhythm,
there is little need to encode data that is extraneous to this goal.
Accordingly we might omit stem-direction, beaming, textual underlay, and even
pitch information.

Note that it is always possible to incorporate additional information at a
later date. Additional information can be inserted into a Humdrum encoding by
using the `**assemble**`_ and `**cleave**`_ commands. In general, it is
important that the encoding of electronic documents not consume all of a
researcher's efforts and resources. The most common problem that beset early
projects in computational musicology was that researchers rarely got past the
stage of inputting data. Early researchers typically ran out of time, money
or enthusiasm before they could turn to *using* the materials they had input.


Documenting Encoded Data
------------------------

More important than generating a complete and accurate database is generating
complete and accurate documentation so that future users of the information
understand the limitations of the materials. Whether or not the electronic
edition is "complete," the materials are almost useless without proper
documentation about what information is present, what information has been
omitted, what sources were used, and what interpretations have been made. As
long as the electronic materials are well documented, users can make
effective use of whatever you create.

An ethnomusicologist may have inaccurately transcribed pitches, but even
approximate pitch information can be used for a study of pitch contour. Of
course, it is better to have clean data than messay data, but even messy data
can be highly useful if the nature of the mess is well understood by
researchers. In fact, most historical information is a mess.

Concretely, Humdrum provides several reference records that allow electronic
editors to identify what information has been encoded and what information
has been omitted or interpreted.


Sources
-------

In light of the editorial goal, you can procede to select source materials
for encoding. In many cases, this will involve selecting printed musical
scores. Begin by spending time with the materials. What special problems or
challenges are raised? What sort of Humdrum representation would be suitable
for the proposed edition? Are there special notational symbols that suggest a
new representation should be designed? Can special representational problems
be accommodated within an existing Humdrum representation? How would users be
made aware of extensions or modifications to the representation?

In the case of musical scores, there is rarely a single source or *Urtext*.
In most cases, multiple sources are available. How do you want to approach
the problem of variant sources? One approach is to select a single source and
remain true to it. A second approach is to identify the principal variant
sources and encode each independently. A third approach is to encode several
variants within a single document and provide Humdrum "versions" that allow
users to select particular "readings" from a single file. A fourth approach
is to create your own "critical" edition -- based on a close re-examination
of the original materials.

An important consideration will be the copyright status of the materials you
examine. Some materials are old enough that their copyrights have expired.
Encoding older materials raises two difficulties. First, older sources are
typically not the best quality editions available. Second, access to printed
versions of older sources may be difficult for other scholars using your
data. Some publishers (such as Dover Publications) specialize in reprinting
musical scores whose copyrights have lapsed. Although these sources may not
be the best available, they are often convenient because other scholars can
easily purchase the modern Dover reprints that correspond to your electronic
edition.

The best materials are usually under copyright. If you encode this material
without permission, you will never be able to distribute the encodings --
even on a non-profit basis. Most modern publishers profess an interest in
electronic publishing, but (at the time of this writing) few publishers have
any pertinent expertise, and fewer yet are willing to encourage or allow the
preparation of electronic documents from their publication catalogue by third
parties. It is likely to take decades before the financial and legal issues
are satisfactorily addressed.

In some cases, you will be translating from one electronic format to another
-- such as from MIDI to ``**kern``_. Once again, be conscious of any
copyright issues that are raised. Few experiences are more discouraging than
discovering that your work cannot be distributed because you failed to
consider seriously the copyright issues involved.


Selecting a Sample from Some Repertory
--------------------------------------

Quite often, there are insufficient resources to encode an entire corpus.
Many repertories are simply too large to consider creating an exhaustive
electronic edition. Nevertheless, you might choose to encode a subset or
selection of works from the given corpus.

A common expectation is that studying a sample subset of works will inform us
about the corpus as a whole. That is, it is commonly expected that studying a
number of works by, say, Offenbach, the scholar may be able to identify
general characteristics of Offenbach's writing. In order for this assumption
to be valid, statisticians tell us that the sample of works must be a
*representative* sample -- free of all sorts of possible selection biases.

From a research perspective, the best sample is a *random sample.* Suppose,
for example, that there are 2,000 items in a particular repertory, but you
are able to encode just 100 items. You might be tempted to select the first
100 items, or to select a subset of items that share some common feature that
makes the collection seem "coherent."

However, picking and choosing what to encode will prevent researchers from
being able to draw general conclusions about the repertory as a whole. For
example, selecting the first 100 items will typically bias the sample to
early works in a composer's career. Selecting 100 random items provides a
very good statistical sample of a population of 2,000 items.

Unfortunately, since random sampling has little precedence in traditional
humanities research, many scholars are resistent to the idea. The value of
random sampling has been established beyond a doubt by statisticians. This is
not the place to rehearse the detailed arguments. Simply take my word for it:
if you can't encode a complete corpus, the very best solution is to select a
random sample.

In making such a random sample, it is essential to resist the temptation to
select a "random" sample "by eye." Establish a truly random procedure (such
as flipping coins or using a random number table) and methodically follow the
procedure.

Incidentally, it is common to run out of resources before completely encoding
the selected materials. As a result, you may end up encoding only half or
two-thirds of the projected materials. If you began encoding the materials in
(say) chronological order, then the resulting database will be biased toward
the early works of the repertory. In order to avoid introducing an unwanted
bias, it is also prudent to encode the selected materials in a random order.


Encoding
--------

Once you have established your materials and have decided on the type of
encoding, you can go ahead and begin encoding the documents in random order.
Use whatever resources are available to you. These might include scanning
software, MIDI performance capture, or the Humdrum `**encode**`_ command.
Begin by encoding a sample section or sections. Spend some time determining
ways to increase your productivity.

As you encode the selected materials, editorial problems or questions will
inevitably arise. As you gain experience, you may realize that earlier
encoding practices were not the best. You may want to return to these
problems and encode them in a different manner. Be sure to keep notes --
either pencil marks on a page, or local comments in a file -- so that you can
easily revisit these problem sites later. Again, it is valuable to encode
works in random order in order to avoid possible confounds arising from
editorial experience. That is, you don't want a scholar's conclusions about
differences between early works and late works to be merely an artifact of
the electronic editor's increasing experience.

Typically, it is more efficient to encode individual parts and then assemble
all parts into a single full score.


Transposing Instruments
-----------------------

In the case of the ``**kern`` representation, all parts are represented at
concert pitch. It is typically easier to encode the parts as written and then
transpose the result using the Humdrum `**trans**`_ command. For example,
material for B-flat trumpet or B-flat clarinet can be transposed using the
following command:

``trans -d -1 -c -2``

In the case of clarinet in A, a suitable transposition would be:

``trans -d -2 -c -3``

The **trans** command adds a transposition interpretation to the output in
order to identify that the material has been shifted. In the ``**kern``
representation, transposed instruments must be explicitly identified using a
special "transposing-instrument interpretation" (see *Humdrum Reference
Manual* -- Section 3 for details). A suitable interpretation can be created
by adding the upper-case letter `I' prior to the `T' in the appropriate
tandem interpretation. In the case of a horn in F for example, the
transpostion interpretation would be modified from

``*Trd-4c-7``

to:

``*ITrd-4c-7``


Instrument Identification
-------------------------

Humdrum provides standardized instrumentation indicators. Three different
types of indication are appropriate: (1) the instrument name as indicated in
the source, (2) standardized instrument name, and (3) instrument class.
Standardized instrument names can be found in `**Appendix II**`_. For
example, the standard indicator for "harpsichord" is ``*Icemba``_.

Standardized instrument class designators include ``*ICklav`` for keyboard
instruments and ``*ICidio`` for percussion instruments, etc., and instrument
grouping designators -- such as ``*IGripn`` for *ripieno* instruments and
``*IGacmp`` for accompaniment instruments. These instrument class designators
can also be found in Appendix II.

In addition, the original instrument name (as found in the score) should also
be encoded as a Humdrum local comment.


Leading Barlines
----------------

Humdrum tools prefer to have explicit information indicating the beginning of
the first measure. If a file does not begin with an anacrusis ("pickup") then
it is appropriate to encode an "invisible" first barline. For a hypothetical
file containing five spines, we would need to insert the following line just
before the first note(s) in the work:

``=1-=1-=1-=1-=1-``

Recall that the common system for representing barlines makes a distinction
between the logical *function* of a barline and it's visual or *orthographic*
appearance. For example, the common system for barlines distinguishes between
double barlines whose function is to indicate the end of a work or movement,
and double barlines that simply delineate sections within the course of a
work or movement. It is possible for a barline at the end of the work to be
"functionally" a double barline, yet appear visually as a single barline.

*Functional double barlines* are encoded with a double equals sign (==)
whether or not they are visually rendered as double barlines. *Functional
single barlines* are encoded with a single equals sign (=) whether or not
they are visually rendered as single barlines.

The specific visual appearance may be encoded following the equals sign(s).
The vertical line (|) represents a `thin' line and the exclamation mark (!)
represents a `thick' line. A typical final double bar would be encoded:

``==|!``

Most mid-movement double bars are encoded with two thin lines and so would be
encoded:

``=||``

A common encoding error is to render mid-movement double barlines as
*functional* rather than *orthographic* double-bars.


Ornamentation
-------------

The ``**kern`` representation makes a distinction between whole-tone and
semitone trills and mordents. Typically, each ornament must be examined
manually and the correct code selected.

In some cases, the size of the trill or mordent will be ambiguous and so some
sort of editorial decision will be necessary. One possibility is to add the
kern `x' signifier immediately following the `T' or `t'. This indicates that
the trill size is an "editorial interpretation."

The ``**kern`` representation treats appoggiaturas in a special way. In
general, ``**kern`` is oriented to representing things in a manner closer to
how they sound. Consequently, appoggiaturas are encoded as they would be
logically performed. For example, a quarter-note preceded by an appoggiatura
(small note) would be performed as two eighth-notes. Similarly, a dotted
quarter-note preceded by an appoggiatura would be performed as a quarter-note
followed by an eighth-note.

All appoggiaturas must be re-encoded in a way that reflects their likely
performance. At the same time, the two notes forming the appoggiatura must be
marked in the kern representation: the initial note of the appoggiatura is
marked by the upper-case letter ``P``' and the final (second) note of the
appoggiatura is marked by a lower-case letter ``p``'.


Editing Sections
----------------

It is helpful to break-up large works/movements into smaller sections that
can be labelled. In a binary work, for example, it may be useful to label the
`A' and `B' sections. In a sonata-allegro work, it may be useful to label the
introduction, exposition, development, recapitulation, etc. Some works
include explicitly notated labels. These labels may be traditional, e.g.
"Coda," or they may reflect programatic descriptions, such as the section
entitled *Il canto degl'uccelli* [The song of the birds] in Vivaldi's *The
Four Seasons.*

Where appropriate, suitable section labels should be created and encoded
using the Humdrum Section Label designator. Remember that section labels can
include the space character:

``*>1st Theme``

If you include section labels, you must also include a Humdrum "Expansion
List" to indicate how the sections are connected. The Humdrum `**thru**`_
command causes a through-composed version of a file to be generated according
to the expansion list. For example, an expansion list for a simple binary
work may be encoded as:

``*>[A,B]``

Remember that expansion lists ought to be encoded prior to the first section
label.

Whenever a work/movement includes repeats or Da Capos, section labels and
expansion lists must be encoded. In some cases, there is more than one way of
interpreting how to realize the repeats. The most "conventional" realization
should be encoded with the *unnamed expansion list.* This will specify the
default expansion using the Humdrum **thru** command. Suppose for example,
that you are encoding a typical minuet and trio. The conventional performance
practice involves repeating all sections of both the minuet and trio, but
then avoiding the repeats in the minuet following the Da Capo. A suitable
expansion list might be:

``*>[Minuet,Minuet,Trio,Trio,,Minuet]``

An alternative expansion list might be encoded as follows (notice the
expansion-list-label *ossia*):

``*>ossia[Minuet,Minuet,Trio,Trio,,Minuet,Minuet]``


Editorialisms in the ***kern* Representation
---------------

Humdrum provides several ways of encoding editorialisms. These include
editorial footnotes, local comments, global comments, interpretation data,
*sic* and *ossia* designations, version labels, sectional labels, and
expansion lists.

The ``**kern``_ representation provides several special-purpose signifiers
to help make explicit various classes of editorial amendments,
interpretations, or commentaries. Five types of editorial signifiers are
available: (1) *sic* (information is encoded literally, but is questionable)
signified by the ``Y`` character; (2) *invisible symbol* (Unprinted note,
rest or barline, but logically implied) signified by the ``y`` character; (3)
*editorial interpretation*, (a "modest" editorial act of interpretation --
such as the interpretation of accidentals in *musica ficta*) signified by the
``x`` character; (4) *editorial intervention* (a "significant" editorial
intervention) signified by the ``X`` character; (5) *footnote* (accompanying
local or global comment provides a text commentary pertaining to specified
data token) signified by ``?``.

One of the most onerous impositions of the ``**kern`` representation is the
requirement that the music be interpreted into a coherent spine organization.
Why not avoid interpreting the voicings?

The answer to this question is that editorial interventions are often
essential clarifications that make a document useable. Without voicing
information, users would be unable to calculate melodic intervals, for
example. Without melodic intervals, it may be impossible to search for
themes, motives, and other patterns. Editorial interpretations are not simply
unwarranted obfuscations. This does not mean that interpretations are
"correct" and so it may be necessary to provide several alternative or
plausible interpretations of an artifact.

One of the advantages of computers is that it is possible for documents to
undergo continuous revision. In research, it is common for documents to be
reinterpreted, annotated, or recast in light of newly found documents.

The kern ``x``' signifies an "editorial interpretation" -- that the
immediately preceding signifier is interpreted. The kern ``xx``' also
signifies an editorial interpretation where the immediately preceding data
token is interpreted. The kern ``X``' signifies an "editorial intervention"
-- that the immediately preceding signifier is an editorial addition. The
kern ``XX``' also signifies an editorial intervention where the immediately
preceding data token is an editorial addition. The kern ``y``' designates a
invisible symbol -- such as an unprinted note or rest that is logically
implied. The kern ``Y``' signifies an editorial *sic* marking -- that the
information is encoded literally, but is questionable. The kern ``?``'
signifies an editorial footnote where the immediately preceding signifier has
an accompanying editorial footnote (located in a comment record). The kern
``??``' signifies an editorial footnote where the immediately preceding data
token has an accompanying editorial footnote (located in a comment record).


Adding Reference Information
----------------------------

Reference information must be added to each file. This information provides
"library-type" information about the composer, date of composition, place of
composition, copyright notice, etc.

As many reference records should be added as possible since these are
immensely useful to Humdrum users. Essential reference records include the
following:

``!!!COM:``composer's name`_
``!!!CDT:``composer's dates`_
``!!!OTL:``title (in original language)`_
``!!!OMV:``movement number (if appropriate)`_
``!!!OPS:``opus number (if appropriate)`_
``!!!ODT:``date of composition`_
``!!!OPC:``place of composition`_
``!!!YEP:``publisher of electronic edition`_
``!!!YEC:``date & owner of electronic copyright`_
``!!!YER:``date electronic edition released`_
``!!!YEM:``copyright message`_
``!!!YEN:``country of copyright`_
``!!!EED:``electronic editor`_
``!!!ENC:``encoder of document`_
``!!!EEV:``electronic edition version`_
``!!!EFL:``file number, e.g. 1 or 4 (1/4)`_
``!!!VTS:``checksum validation number (see below)`_
``!!!AMT:``metric classification`_
``!!!AIN:``instrumentation`_

Where appropriate, the following reference records should also be included:

``!!!CNT:``composer's nationality`_
``!!!XEN:``title (English translation)`_
``!!!OPR:``title of larger (or parent) work`_
``!!!ODE:``dedication`_
``!!!OCY:``country of composition`_
``!!!PPR:``first publisher`_
``!!!PDT:``date first published`_
``!!!PPP:``place first published`_
``!!!SCT:``scholarly catalogue name & number`_
``!!!SMA:``manuscript acknowledgement`_
``!!!AFR:``form of work`_
``!!!AGN:``genre of work`_
``!!!AST:``style of period`_

In general, place essential reference records at the beginning of a document.
These will include the composer, title of the work, etc. Less important
reference records should be placed at the end of the file. Minimizing the
number of reference records at the beginning of a file makes it more
convenient for users looking at the contents of a Humdrum file.

Refer to the *Humdrum Reference Manual* for further information about the
types and format for different reference records.


Proof-reading Materials
-----------------------

Once you have encoded your document, you should create a error-checking
strategy. The Humdrum `**humdrum**`_ command can be used to identify whether
the final encoded output conforms to the Humdrum syntax:

``humdrum full.krn``

Use the Humdrum `**proof`_** **-k** command to identify any syntactical
errors in any encoded ``**kern`` data:

``proof -k full.krn``

One of the best ways to ensure that musical data makes sense is to listen to
it. The Humdrum `**midi**`_ and `**perform**`_ commands can be used to listen
to your data. The **-c** option for **midi** causes the Humdrum data to be
displayed while the MIDI data is performed. This can further help in locating
errors.

``midi -c full.krn | perform``

The **perform** command allows you to *pause* (press the space bar), to
*move* to a particular measure (type a measure number followed by enter), to
increase (type <) or decrease (type >) the *tempo,* and to *return* to the
beginning of the score (type enter). There are many other functions within
the **perform** command; refer to the *Humdrum Reference Manual* -- section 4
for further details.


Data Integrity Using the VTS Checksum Record
--------------------------------------------

When using electronic documents, it is often useful to modify the document
for some purpose. After a while, the user will become confused about the
status of a document. Is this the original distribution file? Did I make some
modification to this file that I've forgotten about? Has someone tampered
with this data?

Humdrum provides a means for ensuring that a particular file is what it
purports to be. The `**veritas**`_ command provides a formal means for
verifying that a given Humdrum file is identical to the original distribution
file and has not been modified in some way.

The **veritas** command works by looking for a VTS reference record in the
file. It then calculates a "checksum" for the file (excluding the VTS record
itself) and compares this value with the encoded VTS value. If these values
differ, a warning is issued that the file has been modified in some way.

Once you are certain that an encoded Humdrum file is completely finished, you
should calculate a "checksum" value to be encoded in a Humdrum "VTS"
reference record.

In order to calculate the checksum value for a given file, use the following
command:

> Open the original file and move to the bottom of the document. Then read in
the calculated checksum value. Finally, insert the ``!!!VTS: ``' reference
record designator.

You can check that everything is fine by invoking the **veritas** command:

> The command will complain only if the VTS checksum value does not
correspond to the computed checksum for the file. Finally, be sure to include
the checksum value in an index or README file for the distribution. This
provides a public venue for users to determine whether the VTS record itself
has not been modified.


Preparing a Distribution
------------------------

Finally, you may want to prepare the material you have encoded for public
distribution. Rename the score files and collect them into a coherent
repertory. If your data is encoded in the ``**kern`` format, be sure to use
the ``.krn`` file extension. Place all resulting Humdrum files in a single
directory.

Create a ``README`` file similar to others in Humdrum data distributions. The
file should contain a repertory title, a brief paragraph describing the
historical background for the works, a paragraph describing the personnel
involved in the production, a copyright and license notice, and a table of
contents. Avoid tabs in this file, and ensure that no line is greater than
80-characters in length.

It is wise to also add a ``LICENSE`` file that reiterates whatever licensing
agreement is entailed for the distributed data.


Electronic Citation
-------------------

Electronic editions of music might be cited in printed or other documents by
including the following information. The "author" (e.g. **!!!COM:**), the
"title" -- either original title (**!!!OTL:**) or translated title
(**!!!XEN:**). The editor (**!!!EED:**), published (**!!!YEP:**), date of
publication and copyright owner (**!!!YED:**), and electronic version
(**EEV:**). In addition, a full citation ought to include the validation
checksum (**!!!VTS:**). The validation number will allow others to verify
that a particular electronic document is precisely the one cited. A sample
citation to an electronic document might be:

> Franz Liszt, Hungarian Rhapsody No. 8 in F-sharp minor (solo piano).
Amsterdam: Rijkaard Software Publishers, 1994; H. Vorisek (Ed.), Electronic
edition version 2.1, checksum 891678772.
