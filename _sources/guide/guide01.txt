Chapter 1: Humdrum: A Brief Tour
=====================================


Humdrum is a general-purpose software system intended to assist music
researchers. Humdrum's capabilities are quite broad, so it is difficult to
describe concisely what it can do. This chapter provides a brief tour through
Humdrum: the goal is to give you a quick glimpse of Humdrum's capabilities
and to help sketch some of the big picture. Don't worry if you don't
understand everything in this chapter. All of the topics mentioned here will
be covered more thoroughly in later chapters.


What Can Humdrum Do?
--------------------

Although Humdrum facilitates exploratory investigations, it is best used when
the user has a clear problem or question in mind. For example, Humdrum allows
users to pose and answer questions such as the following:

-   In the music of Stravinsky, are dissonances more common in strong
    metric positions than in weak metric positions?
-   In Urdu folk songs, how common is the so-called "melodic arch" --
    where phrases tend to ascend and then descend in pitch?
-   What are the most common fret-board patterns in guitar riffs by Jimi
    Hendrix?
-   Which of the Brandenburg Concertos contains the B-A-C-H motif?
-   Which of two different English translations of Schubert lyrics best
    preserves the vowel coloration of the original German?
-   Did George Gershwin tend to use more syncopation in his later works?
-   After the V-I progression, which harmonic progression is most apt to
    employ a suspension?
-   How do chord voicings in barbershop quartets differ from chord
    voicings in other repertories?
-   In what harmonic contexts does Handel double the leading-tone?

Although the Humdrum tools may take just seconds to compute an answer for any
of the above problems, only a few of these questions are *easy* to answer
using Humdrum. The primary impediment to a quick solution is the user's skill
in interconnecting the right tools for the task at hand. The purpose of this
book is to help you develop that skill.


The Humdrum Syntax and the Humdrum Toolkit
------------------------------------------

Humdrum consists of two distinct components: the *Humdrum Syntax* and the
*Humdrum Toolkit.* The *Humdrum Syntax* is a grammar for representing
information. Over the course of this book we'll encounter a variety of
representation schemes that conform to this syntax. The syntax itself doesn't
represent anything: it merely provides a common framework for representing
all sorts of information. Within the syntax an endless number of
representation schemes can be defined. Theoretically, any type of sequential
symbolic data may be accommodated -- such as medieval square notation, MIDI
data, acoustic spectra, piano fingerings, changes of emotional states, Indian
tabla notations, dance steps, Schenkerian graphs, concert programs -- or even
industrial chemical processes.

A number of representation schemes are pre-defined in Humdrum; however, users
are free to concoct their own task-specific representations as necessary. For
example, if you are interested in Telugu notation or Dagomba dance, you can
design your own pertinent representation scheme within the Humdrum syntax.
Humdrum representations may be meticulously crafted, or they may be invented
in a matter of seconds. It is common to generate intermediate or "throw-away"
representations that are used only for a single research task.

The *Humdrum Toolkit* is a set of more than 70 inter-related software tools.
These tools manipulate ASCII data (text) conforming to the Humdrum syntax. If
the ASCII data represents music-related information, then we can say that the
Humdrum tools manipulate music-related information.

What kinds of manipulations can be done with Humdrum? The various Humdrum
tools can be grouped roughly into the following sixteen types of operations.

-   **Visual display.** e.g, display a score beginning at measure 128;
    output the libretto from Act II, Scene 5; print the string parts for the
    Coda -- including the Roman numeral harmonic analysis.
-   **Aural display.** e.g, play the bass trombone part slowly beginning
    at measure 70; play just the opening two measures from all of the works
    in a given repertory.
-   **Searching.** e.g, search for instances of a motive; locate any
    deceptive cadences; find all of the works that are composed for a given
    combination of traditional Japanese instruments.
-   **Counting.** e.g, how often do augmented intervals occur in
    Hungarian folk songs? What proportion of phrases do not begin with a
    pick-up or anacrusis?
-   **Editing.** e.g, change all up-stems to down-stems in measure 88 of
    the second horn part.
-   **Editorializing.** e.g, add an editorial footnote to a specified
    note; indicate that a passage differs from the composer's autograph.
-   **Transforming or translating between representations.** e.g,
    transpose from one key to another; calculate the harmonic intervals
    between two parts; represent a score according to scale-degrees;
    reconstitute chords so they are represented in set *normal form*.
-   **Arithmetic transformations of representations.** e.g, calculate
    the semitone spacings between successive notes, or determine points where
    parts cross in pitch.
-   **Extracting or selecting information.** e.g, extract the second
    verse; exclude the development section; isolate the third phrase; grab
    the second chord in each measure; select the brass parts; take the second
    endings when repeating the trio; choose the Dresden manuscript version.
-   **Linking or joining information.** e.g, assemble instrumental parts
    into a full score; tag notes with their harmonic function; coordinate
    heart-rate data from a listener with the musical score.
-   **Generating inventories.** e.g, list all the types of embellishment
    (non-chordal) tones from the most common to the least common; what chord
    functions are absent from a work?
-   **Classifying.** e.g, classify all chords as "open" or "closed"
    position; identify all secondary dominants; classify all intervals as
    either unisons, steps or leaps; classify various piano fingerings as
    either easy, moderate, difficult, or impossible.
-   **Labelling.** e.g, mark musical sections; label themes; identify
    French, Italian and German sixth chords; mark appropriate words in a
    vocal text as either "passionate," "apathetic," or "neutral." Mark
    sonorities as falling on either strong or weak metric positions.
-   **Comparison.** e.g, determine whether the Amsterdam and Manchester
    manuscripts for a work have identical pitches in the third movement;
    determine whether motets by John Dunstable are more similar to motets by
    Thomas Morley or by Lionel Power.
-   **Capturing Data.** e.g, import live or recorded MIDI data; import
    data from a notation program.
-   **Trouble-shooting.** e.g, identify any transgressions of notational
    conventions; check whether a score has been tampered with; get help when
    you're stuck.

If the above functions sound vague, that's because the corresponding Humdrum
tools are similarly broad in their function. For example, the Humdrum
`**patt**`_ tool can be used to locate Landini cadences, label statements of
12-tone rows, or search for piano fingering patterns in Liszt. All three
tasks involve searching for a sequential pattern that might have concurrent
features as well.

When using computers in research activities, it is important to maintain a
keen awareness of their limitations. For example, computers are typically not
good at *interpreting* data. Because much music scholarship hinges on
interpretations, this would seem to preclude computers from being of much
use. However, there are some things that computers do well, and when a
skilled user intervenes to make a few crucial interpretations, the resulting
computer/human interaction can lead to pretty sophisticated results -- as we
will see.

Although computers are typically not good at interpreting data, interpretive
software will become increasingly important as computational musicology
continues to develop. Humdrum provides a handful of tools that *interpret*
data in various ways. For example, the `**key**`_ command implements the
Krumhansl and Kessler method for estimating the key of a music passage. The
`**melac**`_ command implements Joseph Thomassen's model of melodic accent.
Other interpretive tools characterize syncopation or implement Johnson-
Laird's model of rhythmic prototypes.

The names of some of the Humdrum tools will be readily recognizable by
musicians. Humdrum tools such as `**key,**`_ `**pitch,**`_ `**record,**`_
`**tacet,**`_ `**trans**`_ and `**reihe**`_ may evoke fairly accurate ideas
about what they do. Ironically, the most recognizable tools are typically the
least useful tools in the toolkit -- because they are so specialized. The
most powerful Humdrum tools have names such as `**cleave,**`_ `**humsed,**`_
`**simil,**`_ `**recode,**`_ `**context,**`_ `**patt**`_ and `**yank.**`_

By itself, each individual tool in the Humdrum Toolkit is quite modest in its
effect. However, the tools are not intended to be self-sufficient. They are
designed to work in conjunction with each other, and with existing standard
UNIX commands. Like musical instruments, their potential usefulness is
greatly increased when they are combined with other tools. Musical problems
are typically addressed by linking together successive Humdrum (and UNIX)
commands to form one or more command *pipelines.* Although each individual
tool may have only a modest effect, the tools' combined capacity for solving
complex problems is legion.

Now that we've sketched an overview of Humdrum, we can consider in greater
detail the two principal components of Humdrum: the *Humdrum Syntax* and the
*Humdrum Toolkit*.


Humdrum Syntax
--------------

Humdrum data are organized somewhat like the tables of a spread-sheet. As
with a spread-sheet, you can define or label your own types of data. As with
a spread-sheet, the different *columns* can be set up to represent whatever
type of data you like. The *rows* of data, however, have a fixed meaning --
they represent successive moments in time; that is, time passes as you move
down the page.

By way of example, consider Table 1.1. This table shows something akin to a
piano-roll. The diatonic pitches are labelled in columns from C4 (middle C)
to C5. Each row represents the passage of a sixteenth duration. The table
entries indicate whether the note is *on* or *off*. The table encodes an
ascending scale. As the table stands, it's not clear whether each note has a
duration of an eighth note or whether two successive sixteenth notes are
sounded for each pitch:

**Table 1.1**

> **C4D4E4F4G4A4B4C5**
> 1st 16thONoffoffoffoffoffoffoff
> 2nd 16thONoffoffoffoffoffoffoff
> 3rd 16thoffONoffoffoffoffoffoff
> 4th 16thoffONoffoffoffoffoffoff
> time5th 16thoffoffONoffoffoffoffoff
> 6th 16thoffoffONoffoffoffoffoff
> 7th 16thoffoffoffONoffoffoffoff
> 8th 16thoffoffoffONoffoffoffoff
> 9th 16thoffoffoffoffONoffoffoff
> 10th 16thoffoffoffoffONoffoffoff
> 11th 16thoffoffoffoffoffONoffoff
> etc.

Table 1.2 shows another example where different kinds of information are
combined in the same table. Here the last column represents a combination of
trumpet valves:

**Table 1.2**

> **Pitch**Duration**Valve Combination**
> 1st noteC4quarter0
> 2nd noteB3eighth2
> 3rd noteG4eighth0
> 4th noteF4eighth1
> 5th noteG4eighth0
> 6th noteA4quarter1-2
> 7th noteG4eighth0
> 8th noteAb4quarter2-3

Humdrum representations can be very similar to the data shown in Tables 1.1
and 1.2. With just a few formatting changes, either table can be transformed
so that it conforms to the Humdrum syntax. For example, Table 1.3 recasts
Table 1.2 so that it conforms to the Humdrum syntax. Just four changes have
been made: (1) the left-most column has been given a heading name so that
*every* column has a label, (2) each column heading is preceded by two
asterisks, (3) the columns have been left-justified so successive columns are
separated by a tab, and (4) each column has been terminated with the
combination of an asterisk and hyphen.

**Table 1.3** A Humdrum Equivalent to Table 1.2

``**Note**Pitch**Duration**Valve Combination
> 1st noteC4quarter0
> 2nd noteB3eighth2
> 3rd noteG4eighth0
> 4th noteF4eighth1
> 5th noteG4eighth0
> 6th noteA4quarter1-2
> 7th noteG4eighth0
> 8th noteAb4quarter2-3
> *-*-*-*-``

It does not matter what characters appear in the table -- numbers, letters,
symbols, etc. (although there are some restrictions concerning the use of
spaces and tabs). The table can have as many columns as you like, and can be
as long as you like. Unlike spreadsheet columns, Humdrum "columns" can
exhibit complicated "paths" through the document; columns can join together,
split apart, exchange positions, stop in mid-table, or be introduced in mid-
table. Humdrum also allows subsidiary column headings that can clarify the
state of the data. Subsidiary headings can also be added anywhere in mid-
table. Finally, Humdrum also provides ways of adding running commentaries;
comments might pertain to the whole table, to a given row or column, to a
given data cell, or to a particular item of information within a cell (such
as a single letter or digit). Since the *columns* in Humdrum data can roam
about the table in a semi-flexible way, they are referred to as
`**spines.**`_ We'll see how these devices are used in later chapters.

The most common Humdrum files encode musical notes in the various cells of
the table; the most common use of a spine is to represent a single musical
part or instrument.

Some twenty or more representation schemes are pre-defined in Humdrum, but
remember that users are always free to concoct their own representations as
necessary. As in a spread-sheet, the spines or columns can be used to
represent whatever you like. In the following chapter, we'll look at the most
commonly used of the pre-defined Humdrum representations -- the *kern*
representation. This representation gets its name from the German word for
*core*; it is a scheme intended to represent the basic or core musical
information of notes, durations, rests, barlines, and so on.


Humdrum Tools
-------------

The Humdrum software is not a program that you invoke like a word-processor
or notation editor. Humdrum is not a big program that you start-up when you
want to do music research. Instead, Humdrum provides a toolbox of *utilities*
-- most of which can be accessed at any time from anywhere in the system.

Any data that conforms to the Humdrum syntax can be manipulated using the
Humdrum software tools. Since the tools can be interconnected with each other
(and can also be interconnected with non-Humdrum tools) there are a lot of
ways to manipulate Humdrum data. Much of this book will deal with how the
tools can be interconnected to do musically useful things.

For the remainder of this chapter, we will describe a few Humdrum tools and
illustrate how they might be used. Once again, the goal in this chapter is to
give you an initial taste of Humdrum. Don't worry if you don't understand
everything at this point.


Some Sample Commands
--------------------

One group of tools is used to extract or select sections of data. Vertical
spines of data can be extracted from a Humdrum file using the `**extract**`_
command. For example, if a file encodes four musical parts, then the
**extract** command might be used to isolate one or more given parts. The
command

``extract -f 1 filename``

will extract the first or left-most column or spine of data. Often it is
useful to extract material according to the encoded content without regard to
the position of the spine. For example, the following command will extract
all spines containing a label indicating the tenor part(s).

``extract -i '*Itenor' filename``

Instruments can be labelled by "instrument class" and so can be extracted
accordingly. The following command extracts all of the woodwind parts:

``extract -i '*ICww' filename``

Any vocal text can be similarly extracted:

``extract -i '`**text`_' filename``

Or if the text is available in more than one language, a specific language
may be isolated:

``extract -i '*LDeutsch' filename``

Segments or passages of music can be extracted using the `**yank**`_ command.
Segments can be defined by sections, phrases, measures, or other any user-
specified marker. For example, the following command extracts the section
labelled "Trio" from a minuet & trio:

``yank -s Trio -r 1 filename``

Or select the material in measures 114 to 183:

``yank -n = -r 114-183 filename``

Or select the second-last phrase in the work:

``yank -o { -e } -r '$-1' filename``

Don't worry about the complex syntax for these commands; the command formats
will be discussed fully in the ensuing chapters. For now, it is important
only that you get a feel for some of the types of operations that Humdrum
users might perform.

Two or more commands can be connected into a *pipeline.* The following
command will let us determine whether there are any notes in the bassoon
part:

``extract -i '*Ifagot' filename | census -k``

The following pipeline connects together four commands: it will play (using
MIDI) the first and last measures from a section marked "Coda" at half the
notated tempo from a file named ``Cui``:

``yank -s '*>Coda' Cui | yank -o ^= -r 1,$ | midi | perform -t .5``

Some tools translate from one representation to another. For example, the
`**mint**`_ command generates melodic interval information. The following
command locates all tritones -- including compound (octave) equivalents:

``mint -c filename | egrep -n '((d5)|(A4))'``

Incidentally, Humdrum data can be processed by many common commands that are
not part of the Humdrum Toolkit. The **egrep** command in the above pipeline
is a common computer utility and is not part of the Humdrum Toolkit.

Depending on the type of translation, the resulting data can be searched for
different things. The following command identifies French sixth chords:

``solfa file | extract -i '`**solfa`_' | ditto | grep '6-.*4+' | grep 2``

Locate all sonorities in the music of Machaut where the seventh scale degree
has been doubled:

``deg -t machaut* | grep -n '7[^-+].*7'``

Count the number of phrases that end on the subdominant pitch:

``deg filename | egrep -c '(}.*4)|(4.*})'``

The following command identifies all scores whose instrumentation includes a
tuba but not a trumpet:

``grep -sl '!!!AIN.*tuba' * | grep -v 'tromp'``

Some tasks may require more than one command line. For example, the following
three-line script locates any parallel fifths between the bass and alto
voices of any input file:

``echo P5 > P5
echo '= *' >> P5; echo P5 >> P5
extract -i '*Ibass,*Ialto' file | hint -c | pattern -s = P5``

More complicated scripts can be written to carry out more sophisticated
musical processes. In later chapters we'll encounter some scripts that
contain 10 or more lines of commands.

Reprise
-------

In this chapter we have seen that Humdrum consists of two parts: (1) a
representation *syntax* that is similar to tables in a spread-sheet, and (2)
a set of utilities or *tools* that manipulate Humdrum data in various ways.
The tools carry out operations such as displaying, performing, searching,
counting, editing, transforming, extracting, linking, classifying, labelling
and comparing. The tools can be linked together to carry out a wide variety
of tasks. Even one-line commands can carry out sophisticated operations. A
few lines of Humdrum can also be used to write programs of some complexity.
Users can write their own programs using the Humdrum tools, or they can add
new tools that augment the functioning of Humdrum.
