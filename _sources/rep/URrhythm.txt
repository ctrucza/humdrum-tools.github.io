Humdrum Representation for Beat Prototypes
==========================================

REPRESENTATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    **\*\*URrhythm** -- represent Johnson-Laird beat prototypes for a
    passage

DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~

    The **\*\*URrhythm** representation encodes beat "prototypes"
    (Ur-rhythms) evident in a musical passage. The representation is
    based on Johnson-Laird's theory of rhythmic prototypes (see
    `**REFERENCES** <#REFERENCES>`__ below).

    The **\*\*URrhythm** representation characterizes each beat in a
    passage as belonging to one of three "beat types": *Note* (N),
    *Syncopation* (S), or *Other* (O). Only principle beats are
    characterized in this way. Hence, in 3/4 or 9/8 meters, three beats
    are characterized for each complete measure. Similarly, in 4/2 and
    12/16, four beats are characterized for each complete measure.
    Johnson-Laird's rhythmic-prototype theory can be applied only to
    musical passages conforming to regular meters (simple and compound,
    duple, triple and quadruple).

    A "Note" (signified in the output by the letter \`N') is defined as
    a beat that coincides with a note onset.

    A metric "Syncopation" (signified by the letter \`S') is defined as
    arising when no note-onset happens on a beat whose metric position
    is more important than that of the most recent note onset. By way of
    example, imagine a measure in 4/4 meter containing a quarter-note,
    followed by a half-note, followed by a quarter-note. The third beat
    position does not coincide with a note onset. The most recent note
    onset prior to the third beat occurs on beat two. Since beat three
    is a more important metric position than beat two, beat three is
    deemed to be syncopated.

    Metrically syncopated beats can happen only after the first note
    onset; subsequent syncopated moments require another note onset
    (i.e. two syncopated moments can't occur in a row without some note
    onset intervening).

    An "Other" (signified by the letter \`O') is any beat that is not a
    Note (N) or a syncopation (S).

    Barlines are represented using the "common system" for barlines --
    see `**barlines** <barlines.rep.html>`__.

FILE TYPE
~~~~~~~~~

    It is recommended that files containing predominantly ``**URrhythm``
    data should be given names with the distinguishing \`.urr'
    extension.

    signifiers and signifieds.
