REPRESENTATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    **\*\*degree** -- absolute scale degree representation

DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~

    The **\*\*degree** representation can be used to represent
    key-dependent scale-degree information for music in major or minor
    keys. The **\*\*degree** representation differs from the related
    `**\*\*deg** <deg.rep.html>`__ representation in that it encodes
    absolute rather than relative pitch-height information.

    Three types of data tokens are distinguished by **\*\*degree**:
    scale degree tokens, rest tokens, and barlines.

    Scale degree tokens are encoded as a combination of degree values,
    degree alterations, and octave designations. The scale degree values
    are indicated by the numbers 1 (tonic) to 7 (leading-tone). These
    values may be chromatically altered by raising (+) or lowering (-).
    The *amount* of chromatic alteration is not indicated; for example,
    a raised super-tonic is represented as ``2+`` whereas a
    doubly-raised super-tonic is also represented as ``2+``. A lowered
    submediant is represented as ``6-``.

    A second integer value is used to indicate the octave following the
    ANSI standard pitch designations. For example, the pitch A4 lies in
    octave 4. (Octaves begin at C and end at B.) In order to avoid
    confusing scale degrees with octave indications the slash character
    is used as a sub-token separator. For example, the pitch C4 in the
    key of C major is represented as ``1/4``, while the pitch A#4 in the
    key of G major is represented as ``2+/4``.

    Scale degree tokens are always represented with respect to a
    prevailing major or minor *key.* In the case of minor keys, scale
    degrees are characterized with respect to the *harmonic minor* scale
    only. By way of example, the pitch F4 in the key of A minor is
    represented as the submediant (``6/4``) while F#4 is represented as
    the raised submediant (``6+/4``). In the same key, G4 is represented
    as the lowered seventh (``7-/4``) while G#4 is the normal
    leading-tone (``7/4``). In the key of A major, F4 is represented as
    the lowered submediant (``6-/4``).

    Rests are represented by the single letter \`r'.

    Barlines are represented using the "common system" for barlines --
    see `**barlines** <barlines.rep.html>`__.

FILE TYPE
~~~~~~~~~

    It is recommended that files containing predominantly ``**degree``
    data should be given names with the distinguishing \`.dgr'
    extension.

SIGNIFIERS

    signifiers and signifieds.
