Humdrum Representation for Relative Scale Degree

REPRESENTATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    **\*\*deg** -- relative scale degree representation

DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~

    The **\*\*deg** representation can be used to represent
    key-dependent scale-degree information for music in major or minor
    keys. The **\*\*deg** representation differs from the related
    `**\*\*degree** <degree.rep.html>`__ representation in that it
    encodes relative rather than absolute pitch-height information.

    Three types of data tokens are distinguished by **\*\*deg**: scale
    degree tokens, rest tokens, and barlines.

    Scale degree tokens are encoded as a combination of melodic
    approach, degree value, and degree alteration. The caret (^) denotes
    an ascending melodic approach to the current note, whereas the
    lower-case letter v denotes a descending melodic approach. Repeated
    pitches carry no melodic approach signifier. The scale degree values
    are indicated by the numbers 1 (tonic) to 7 (leading-tone). These
    values may be chromatically altered by raising (+) or lowering (-).
    The *amount* of chromatic alteration is not indicated; for example,
    a raised super-tonic is represented as ``2+`` whereas a
    doubly-raised super-tonic is also represented as ``2+``. A lowered
    submediant is represented as ``6-``.

    Scale degree tokens are always represented with respect to a
    prevailing major or minor *key.* In the case of minor keys, scale
    degrees are characterized with respect to the *harmonic minor* scale
    only. By way of example, the pitch F in the key of A minor is
    represented as the submediant (``6``) while F# is represented as the
    raised submediant (``6+``). In the same key, G is represented as the
    lowered seventh (``7-``) while G#4 is the normal leading-tone
    (``7``). In the key of A major, F is represented as the lowered
    submediant (``6-``). If this pitch was approached from below, it
    would be encoded as ``^6-`` -- whereas if it was approached from
    above, it would be encoded as ``v6-``.

    Rests are represented by the single letter \`r'.

    Barlines are represented using the "common system" for barlines --
    see `**barlines** <barlines.rep.html>`__.

FILE TYPE
~~~~~~~~~

    It is recommended that files containing predominantly ``**deg`` data
    should be given names with the distinguishing \`.deg' extension.

SIGNIFIERS
~~~~~~~~~~

    The following table summarizes the **\*\*deg** mappings of
    signifiers and signifieds.

        +-------+---------------------------------------+
        | v     | descending melodic approach           |
        +-------+---------------------------------------+
        | -     | scale degree lowered by one -tone     |
        +-------+---------------------------------------+
        | --    | scale degree lowered by two -tones    |
        +-------+---------------------------------------+
        | +     | scale degree raised by one semitone   |
        +-------+---------------------------------------+
        | r     | rest                                  |
        +-------+---------------------------------------+
        | =     | barline; == double barline            |
        +-------+---------------------------------------+

    Fugue in C minor in the second volume of Bach's *Well Tempered
    Clavier.* The left spine shows a `**\*\*kern** <kern.rep.html>`__
    encoding while the right spine shows a corresponding **\*\*deg**
    encoding.

PERTINENT COMMANDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The following Humdrum command accepts **\*\*deg** encoded data as
    inputs:

        `**vox** <../commands/vox.html>`__
        determine active and inactive voices in a Humdrum file

    The following Humdrum command produces **\*\*deg** data as output:

        `**deg** <../commands/deg.html>`__
        translates **\*\*kern, \*\*pitch, \*\*Tonh, \*\*solfg**, to
        **\*\*deg**

TANDEM INTERPRETATIONS
