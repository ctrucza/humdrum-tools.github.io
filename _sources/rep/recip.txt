REPRESENTATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    **\*\*recip** -- beat-proportion representation

DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~

    The **\*\*recip** scheme is able to represent durations according to
    the traditional system of beat-proportions (rather than according to
    elapsed- or clock-time.) Durations are specified through the use of
    integer numbers and augmentation dots. With the exception of the
    value zero, durations are represented by reciprocal numerical
    values. For example:

        0
        breve duration
        1
        whole duration
        2
        half duration
        4
        quarter duration
        8
        eighth duration
        16
        sixteenth duration
        32
        thirty-second duration
        64
        sixty-fourth duration
        etc.
        *Representations of Duration in **\*\*recip***

    The number zero (0) is reserved for the *breve* duration (i.e. a
    duration of twice the length of a whole note). Dotted durations are
    indicated by adding the period character (.) after the numerical
    value:

        2.
        dotted half duration
        8..
        doubly-dotted eighth duration
        etc.
        *Representation of Dotted Durations in **\*\*recip***

    Any number of augmentation dots may follow the duration integer.ยง ยง
    Notice that the period is used both to indicate Humdrum null tokens
    and **\*\*recip** augmentation dots. In parsing **\*\*recip**
    spines, there is never any confusion concerning the meaning of the
    period: as a null token, the period will appear isolated from all
    other characters (by tabs or carriage returns). As an augmentation
    dot, the period will always follow a number.

    Triplet and other irregular durations are represented in a somewhat
    more arcane, though no less logical fashion. Consider, for example,
    the quarter-note triplet duration. Three quarter triplets occur in
    the time of four quarters or one whole duration. If we divide a
    whole duration ("1") into three equal parts, each part has a
    duration of one-third. The corresponding reciprocal integer for 1/3
    is 3, hence **\*\*recip** represents a quarter-note triplet as a
    "third-note" -- 3. Similarly, eighth-note triplets are represented
    by the integer 6 while sixteenth-note triplets are represented by
    the integer 12. Eighth-note quintuplets (5 in the time of 4) will be
    represented by the value 10 (a half duration divided by 5).

    In general, the way to determine the **\*\*recip** equivalent of an
    arbitrary "tuplet" duration is to multiply the number of tuplets by
    the total duration which they occupy. If 7 notes of equal duration
    occupy the duration of a whole-note ("1"), then each septuplet is
    represented by the value 7 (i.e. 1 x 7). A more extreme example is
    23 notes in the time of a doubly-dotted quarter. The appropriate
    **\*\*recip** duration can be found by multiplying 4 by 23 (equals
    92) and adding the appropriate augmentation dots. Thus "92.." is the
    correct **\*\*recip** encoding for a note whose duration is 23 notes
    in the time of a doubly-dotted quarter.

    The **\*\*recip** representation can be used to encode a sequence of
    time-spans or successive durations. The units are inverse time
    units.

    Barlines are represented using the "common system" for barlines --
    see `**barlines** <barlines.rep.html>`__.

FILE TYPE
~~~~~~~~~

    It is recommended that files containing predominantly ``**recip``
    data should be given names with the distinguishing \`.rcp'
    extension.
